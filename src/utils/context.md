# Utils - Technical Context

## Overview
The utils folder contains comprehensive character data definitions and utility functions for the BUGCHUD tabletop RPG digital implementation. This module serves as the central repository for all game data including races, origins, backgrounds, equipment, spells, and character generation logic.

## Core Functions

### `generateAttributes(): { twitch: number; flesh: number; mojo: number; zimes: number }`
**Purpose**: Generates the four core attribute values using 1d4 rolls as per BUGCHUD rules
**Implementation**: Creates four random values (1-4) and assigns them to the three attributes plus leftover zimes
**Usage**: Called during character creation to establish base attribute scores
**Dependencies**: Math.random() for dice simulation
**Side Effects**: None - pure function with no external state modification

### `applyRacialModifiers(baseAttributes, race): AttributeScore objects`
**Purpose**: Applies racial attribute loyalties (favored/middling/treacherous) to base attribute scores
**Implementation**: Combines numeric values with loyalty types based on selected race
**Usage**: Called after attribute generation to create final attribute scores with racial modifiers
**Dependencies**: Race interface and AttributeScore types
**Side Effects**: None - returns new objects without modifying inputs

### `calculateDerivedStats(attributes): { bones: number; manaDice: number }`
**Purpose**: Calculates derived statistics from core attributes
**Implementation**: Bones = Flesh value, Mana Dice = Mojo Ã— 2
**Usage**: Called during character creation after attributes are finalized
**Dependencies**: AttributeScore interface
**Side Effects**: None - pure calculation function

### `getBackgroundsByOrigin(origin): Background[]`
**Purpose**: Filters available backgrounds based on character origin
**Implementation**: Array filtering based on background origin property
**Usage**: Used in character creator to show only valid background options
**Dependencies**: BACKGROUNDS array and OriginType
**Side Effects**: None - returns filtered array without modification

### `validateCharacterBackgrounds(backgrounds): boolean`
**Purpose**: Validates background selection follows BUGCHUD rules
**Implementation**: Checks unique background constraints and origin distribution
**Usage**: Form validation during character creation
**Dependencies**: Background interface
**Side Effects**: None - validation function only

## Internal Architecture

### File Structure
- `character-data.ts` - All interfaces, data arrays, and utility functions

### Data Flow
1. Character creation starts with attribute generation
2. Racial modifiers applied to create final attributes
3. Origin selection determines available backgrounds
4. Background selection provides starting equipment and abilities
5. Optional faith selection for divine powers
6. Equipment and spell selection from available pools

### Key Patterns
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all game data
- **Modular Data**: Separate arrays for each game element type
- **Validation Functions**: Built-in validation for character creation rules
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for common operations

## Dependencies

### Internal
- No internal dependencies - self-contained utility module

### External
- TypeScript for type definitions and compilation
- Standard JavaScript Math library for random number generation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Character Creation
```typescript
import { generateAttributes, applyRacialModifiers, RACES, ORIGINS } from '@/utils/character-data';

// Generate base attributes
const baseAttribs = generateAttributes(); // { twitch: 3, flesh: 1, mojo: 4, zimes: 2 }

// Apply racial modifiers
const dwarf = RACES.find(r => r.id === 'dwarf');
const finalAttribs = applyRacialModifiers(baseAttribs, dwarf);
// Result: { twitch: {value: 3, loyalty: 'middling'}, flesh: {value: 1, loyalty: 'favored'}, mojo: {value: 4, loyalty: 'treacherous'} }
```

### Background Validation
```typescript
import { getBackgroundsByOrigin, validateCharacterBackgrounds, BACKGROUNDS } from '@/utils/character-data';

// Get valid backgrounds for origin
const barbaricBackgrounds = getBackgroundsByOrigin('barbaric');

// Validate background selection
const selectedBackgrounds = [scholar, warrior, shaman]; // Example selection
const isValid = validateCharacterBackgrounds(selectedBackgrounds); // false - scholar not from barbaric origin
```

### Equipment Filtering
```typescript
import { WEAPONS, ARMOR } from '@/utils/character-data';

// Find all light weapons
const lightWeapons = WEAPONS.filter(w => w.weight === 'light');

// Find armor by protection level
const heavyArmor = ARMOR.filter(a => a.protection >= 5);
```

## Error Handling
- Validation functions return boolean results for character creation rules
- Array filtering safely handles empty results
- Type system prevents invalid data assignments
- Optional properties handle missing data gracefully

## Performance Considerations
- All data arrays are pre-computed constants for fast access
- Filtering operations are performed on relatively small datasets
- Pure functions enable safe memoization if needed
- No external API calls or async operations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utility functions with edge cases
- Validation tests for character creation rule compliance
- Data integrity tests for cross-references between arrays
- Type checking through TypeScript compilation

## Future Considerations
- Additional races and backgrounds as game expands
- More complex equipment with magical properties
- Advanced spell schools and metamagic systems
- Character progression and experience systems
- Integration with campaign management features
