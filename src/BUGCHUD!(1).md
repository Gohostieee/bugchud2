Pysdonia, whose namesake is derived from its former god-ruler, is on the brink.

Having only barely survived the Inhumen Crisis a mere 1,000 years ago, the land had truly never recovered. Constant warring strife between the factions of Psydonia have prevented reunification – and all live in constant anxiety of dreaded Inhumenity, whose sinister faith threatens to unravel the world itself, once and for all.

Scholars have named this malaise and instability the Bugchud – the slow doom of a world once thought imperishable, not slain in an awe inspiring war or apocalypse, but killed by slow bickering and decay. A pathetic decline.

The death-throes of Psydonia rattle, and all hear it, as the clock moves closer to midnight.

## 

# CHAPTER 0: INTRODUCTION

## 

## 

## Author's Notes on Bugchud's design

Bugchud was not made to accommodate a character with a pre-made narrative idea. The GM is not ordained to find any inherent value in a player’s character. On the contrary, Bugchud as a system doesn’t find inherent value in the life of anyone. 

Characters exist to be shot, stabbed, burnt and crushed. All of these rules are written with the expectation of the GM to not show mercy, because the world itself has no mercy.

However, that isn’t to say that players are helpless. You will play extraordinary men and women. With clever guile, brute force, or magical ability, you may yet overcome the violence of this world.

## List of Inspirations

Good artists are inspired, great artists steal\!

### Roguetown

Many of the names of characters were lifted straight from these game-servers, whose dark fantasy provided much of the foundation for the world of Psydonia. Without Roguetown, Bugchud would look unrecognizable.

### Wizards (1977)

Among the largest influences for Bugchud. Ralph Bakshi’s wizards illustrated a weird-fantasy world, filled with automatic rifles, mutants – pixies and elves.

In the early days of Bugchud’s design, Wizards concept art was used in the book. However, we’d not like to get sued, so we had to get rid of it\!

### Lifeweb

Whose miserable theater of pain gave us the more extreme science-fiction found in this book, along with the theology of certain factions.

### Cruelty Squad

Cruelty Squad’s black humor and dystopian world-view influenced much of the general vibe of Bugchud.

### HellMOO

A relic from its time, HellMOO’s early 2000s edge influenced not just the setting, but the design of Bugchud itself.

### Mad God

This near dialogue-less stop-motion movie gave aesthetic inspiration with its hellish, disgusting battlefields.

## Game Terminology

Below is a list of different words that are used in this book. 

### Dice

You know what dice are.

BUGCHUD uses lots, especially d6s.

### Soaks

Chance for damage reduction (the damage was soaked up\!)

When hit by melee strikes, the attacker has to beat your Soaks to roll for damage.

When hit by ranged fire, the attacker subtracts from the ranged attack’s damage.

### Damage

Application of Wound Points.

### Success

Rolling a 3+ on a d6 die.

# 

# CHAPTER 1: ATTRIBUTES & THE PARTY SHEET

## Attribute Scores

There are three primary attributes in BUGCHUD\!: TWITCH, FLESH, and MOJO. Each character is scored using these attributes as a framework. In addition, some primary attributes have their own derived stats, laid out underneath.

### Twitch

Twitch covers;

* Hand-eye coordination.  
* Noticing if ‘something is off’.  
* Reaction speed.  
* Ranged combat.

### Flesh

Flesh covers;

* Feats of strength  
* Sturdy skin  
* Melee combat.

#### Bones

Characters may ignore a number of Wound Points equal to their Bones stat \-- this isn’t damage reduction, it’s literally ignored. IE, if I have 3 Wound Points, and 2 Bones, I act as though I only had 1 Wound Point.

Bones is equal to a character’s Flesh attribute.

### Mojo

Mojo covers;

* Strange happenings.  
* Luck.  
* Divining fates.  
* Magic of all sorts.

#### 

#### Mana Dice

Maximum amount of MD that a character can use. Fuel for black magick. 

Mana Dice is equal to twice a character’s Mojo attribute.

Whenever Mojo is gained, the user also gains the MD that the Mojo would grant (2 MD).

# 

# CHAPTER 2: CHECKS & SAVES

## 

## Dice

Bugchud primarily uses d6 dice, but d20s, d10s and d4s are also used. You’ll also need some way to roll a d1000.

If you ever see the term \+(number)D, that means you add a number of extra d6 to the roll equal to whatever that number was.

## 

## Checks

| *DC* | *Successes* |
| :---: | :---: |
| Easy | 1 |
| Challenging | 2 |
| Difficult | 3 |
| Incredibly Difficult | 4+ |

Whenever it isn’t immediately apparent if a character will succeed or fail at a given task, or if there is timed pressure on the character, the GM can call for an Attribute Check.

The GM will declare how many successes a character will need to overcome the task at hand, known as the difficulty class (DC). The character will then roll a number of d6 dice equal to the attribute most relevant.

Failure; 1-4  
Success; 5-6

A check in this book would be written as XS+, with X being the number of successes required to succeed. As an example, a 2S+ Flesh check would require 2 successes.

Depending on the check, the GM should roll it in secret on behalf of the player. Some examples of this would include things like searching for traps, where a visible failure would alarm the party should nothing be found or seen

### Attribute Loyalty

Dice have different loyalties, which add bonuses or detriments to the dice rolls themself. This is determined during character creation. See below:

#### Favored (\*)

A favored attribute is labeled with \* to mark its oath of loyalty in your labors.

\+1 to dice results.

#### 

#### Middling

A middling attribute is not labeled. It is not important enough to warrant extra hand movements for designation. Likewise, it’s not chosen; it’s simply an attribute that isn’t Favored or Treacherous.

#### 

#### treacherous (\!)

A treacherous attribute is labeled with \! to warn of its sinister nature.

\-1 to dice results.

### Advantage

If a character clearly has some sort of leg up on a given task, they receive \+1D to the task. This could be anything from knowing hidden knowledge or receiving assistance from another character. This is known as advantage.

Advantage can only be applied once.

## Saves

Certain events will trigger a save. To see if you overcome this adversity, roll a d20. If the result matches or exceeds the save’s designated requirement, consequences are avoided. Different bonuses can be added to the roll, and likewise, detriments may subtract.

### Death (8)

Death saves are used to avoid the consequences for;

* Dying of fright.  
* Black magick curses.  
* Particularly lethal venom.

Only magical objects can assist with saves vs Death.

### Zealotry (10)

Zealotry saves are used to avoid the consequences for;

* Divine wrath.  
* Nite-Creecher attacks or abilities.

Zealotry saves are also used to call upon divine miracles and favor.

Bearing holy iconography can assist with saves vs Zealotry.   
Incurring Canticle Debt subtracts from saves vs Zealotry.

### Fear (12)

Fear saves are used to avoid the consequences for;

* Witnessing horrible violence.  
* Witnessing grotesque monsters.

Saves vs Fear receive \-1 for each Stress Dice a character has.

### Physique (15)

Physique saves are used to avoid the consequences for;

* Being poisoned.  
* Resisting addiction.  
* Paralysis.

Every point of Flesh adds \+1 to saves vs Physique.

### Dodge (18)

Dodge saves are used to avoid the consequences for;

* Falling debris.  
* Being run over by a vehicle.  
* Jumping out of the way of explosions.

Every point of Twitch adds \+1 to saves vs Dodge.  
Characters without armor add \+4 to saves vs Dodge.  
Characters wearing light armor add \+2 to saves vs Dodge.  
Characters wearing heavy armor subtract \-2 from saves vs Dodge.

### Magic (20)

Magic saves are used to avoid the consequences for;

* Magical effects.  
* Cursed objects.

Every point of Mojo adds \+1 to saves vs Magic.  
Arcane trinkets can assist with saves vs Magic.

# CHAPTER 3: CHARACTER CREATION

## 

## Step 1: Choose Your Race

Psydonia is a fractured and ruined world, occupied by a myriad of peoples. A player may choose from among the four main races; humens, dwarves, elves, and halflings.

A player may opt to be a half-breed of two chosen races. However, this dysgenic creature will inherit only the worst qualities from their parents (no favored attributes).

### Humen

Humens are the preeminent race of Psydonia and live anywhere that can support life.

Humens begin the game with no favored or treacherous attributes.

*Made in Psydon’s image, Humenity was created to wage war upon Elf-kind.*

### Dwarf

Dwarves are bound by the ties of kith and kin, and their promises are ironclad. Most dwarves live in fortresses in the mountain-sides, but many take to adventure.

Dwarves begin the game with favored Flesh, but treacherous Mojo.

*In Godhood, Malum fashioned the first Dwarves from rock and stone to emulate the warmth of life.*

### Elf

Elves are mistrusted at best and reviled at worst by the other races of Psydonia, as they sided with Zizo during the Inhumen Crisis. Most occupy the Darklands.

Elves begin the game with favored Mojo, but treacherous Flesh.

Elves do not receive Xom points from contaminated areas.

*Elves were born outside of Psydon’s grace in a world before time. When Zizo slew the God-King of man, most Elves followed her blasphemy and swore loyalty to the Inhumen.*

### 

### Halfling

Halflings are regarded as ill-mannered, rude and trashy. They are stereotyped as good for nothing thieves and vagrants, wanderers by character but nasty by choice.

Halflings begin the game with favored Twitch, but treacherous Flesh.

*When Malum created Dwarf-Kind, Xylix fashioned a parody and christened them Halflings as good spirited fun.*

## Step 2: Roll for Attributes & Assign Loyalties

Roll 1d4. Repeat this process until you have 4 results.

Allocate each of these numbers to a respective attribute. You’ll have a number leftover \-- save this number for Step 5\.

## Step 3: Choose your Origin & Backgrounds

Your origin is the land that you were born and raised in.

Choose an origin, and then choose three backgrounds. You must choose a minimum of two backgrounds tied to your origin. The third background may be picked from any origin.

Backgrounds designated with \*\* are unique. Only one unique background can be chosen.

### Pseudo-Civilized

You hail from land not yet totally stained by the touch of the Inhumen. A proper wasteland in any other world, but the closest thing to civilization in Psydonia. Various feudal holdings and military dictatorships have carved up the land since Psydon’s death, constantly warring between each other.

#### Fighter

Fighters may add \+1 or \-1 to their locational hit rolls.

*The only virtue; cold steel.*

#### Rogue

May reroll Twitch checks for any suitably ‘roguish’ activities (sneaking, pickpocketing, lockpicking, etc)

*It is said that rogues are often acquainted with destiny.*

#### Scholar

You know 1d4 facts about any given subject.

*Many scholars believe we live in the end of days; that Zizo’s victory fast approaches.*

#### Devout

Begin the game with a relic associated with your deity. (The GM will create it)

*The Gods of today were not meant to be \- all know this, even if they won’t admit it.*

#### Noble-Blooded 

You do not pay deposit taxes on Shylocks and begin the game with an extra Pouch of Zimes

*It is common knowledge that all noble houses in Psydonia are descended from the mortal Astrata.*

#### Monster Hunter

Know the signs of a nite-creecher’s presence and receive advantage when fighting them.

*There are no more a hideous beest than the nightmarish kin of Kain.*

#### Duelist

You may make Twitch checks rather than Flesh checks when attacking with one handed melee weapons.

*Fighters of guile and reflex are oddities in Psydonia, but seen as good omens for the lands they travel through.*

### Barbaric

You hail from the frigid North. It is here that the Inhumen ascended, and likewise, where the heroes of legend made their final stand against villainy. It is a land of constant crusade and skirmish, where terrors and heroes make pilgrimage to die in glory. 

Those of Barbaric origins typically worship more primitive variations of existing faiths \- their beliefs syncretized to native worship of spirits, winds and fires. Graggar and Ravox are particularly favored.

#### \*\*Berserker\*\*

Once per day during combat, scream to the Gods and rage. Receive half damage for as long as the rage lasts and receive \+1 damage to all melee attacks. (Roll 1d6 at the end of each turn  \- a roll of 1 ends the rage. Roll an extra d6 for each turn the rage has been active.)

*Fury and spittle, of pasts forgotten and futures that you’ll never live.*

#### Savage

If naked, whenever rolling for a save vs dodge, roll 2d20 and choose the preferred result. Weather and climate do not bother you.

*Known as The Way of Babes & Legends to those who practice it, it is rooted in the Northern belief that the beautiful will be spared death \- so long as they bare their skin to the world.*

#### Hunter

The first arrow fired at a target always hits.

*Hunts of trolls and nite-creechers are common coming of age ceremonies for young warriors.*

#### \*\*Shaman\*\*

May spend 2 MD in place of incurring Canticle Debt if incurred via making a save vs Zealotry.

*Wyrdmen of the North oft’ worship mana outright, conflating the Gods with the natural material of existence.*

#### Nomad

No penalty to ranged attacks while on a moving vehicle or mount. Reroll rolls determining if the party becomes lost.

*Sons and daughters of the steppes honor no laws, save for loyalty to their blood and acknowledgment that their home is a cruel mistress.*

#### Raider

No penalty for dual wielded melee attacks.

*Disparate tribes raid each other regularly for prestige, women and wealth. Woe onto the civilized kingdoms and polities when this fury is turned Southward, united by common-cause or an ambitious warlord.*

#### 

#### Skinwalker

Bare-fists and bites are treated as Medium weapons without extra mechanics.

*O’ hideous Ritualists of the Steppes and Tundra, who, in having made pact with spirits of blood and bone, sought the strength of bull and bear – becoming closer to beast than man.*

### 

### Darklands

You hail from lands stained by curse and black magick. Lonesome city-states aligned with the Inhumen dot what is otherwise desolate and mutated wastelands. Nite-creechers of all sorts prowl the landscape at night, and nightmarish machines are commonplace.

#### \*\*Wizard\*\*

Begin the game with a grimoire containing the spells Lightning Bolt and Read Mind.

*… And thereupon, Zizo witnessed the injustice of creation and spilled her tar-pitch blood into the world-weave as vengeance \- the first black magick, to poison the godhead…*

#### Vicious

Add \+1 to all melee attacks.

*Cruelty breeds cruelty in the Darklands. Only the monstrous survive.*

#### Mutant

Begin the game by rolling from the mutation table twice.

Whenever rolling for Mutation, roll 2d1000 and choose the preferred result.

*Zizo’s final retribution stained the land itself with black magick, and with it, those who lived there.*

#### Perfumer Apprentice

You know how to brew alchemical potions and powders.

*Once aligned with Psydon, many perfumers have since pledged themselves to Eoran heresies, otherwise known as Baothan Vice. They seclude themselves in their laboratories, innovating upon their chemical blisses.*

#### Archon (Inhumen worshippers only)

You retain a small title of nobility within an Inhumen city-state. You cannot be killed without recourse.

*The elite of the Darklands rule over their city-states with the touch of death and the sting of pain.*

#### Former Slave

\+2 to Saves vs Physique.

*It is said that in the city-states, a man’s wealth isn’t measured in the slaves he owns, but how willing he is to squander their lives.*

#### Cyborg

Begin the game with a Major bionic of your choice.

*The chronicles of man are incomplete – and Zizo’s first gift to her brothers and sisters were forgotten engineerings and knowledge.*

#### Infantry

Whenever rolling for Ammo Scarcity, roll one fewer dice (cannot reduce the number of dice rolled below 1).

*Common in the Darklands, advanced firearms are a mainstay of Elvish raiding parties.*

#### Dread-Tongued

You know how to speak the Black Word, the language spoken by nite-creechers, liches and Zizo cultists.

*The ancestral language of ElF-kind, once lost to the winds of time.*

## Step 4: Choose your Faith

Player chooses their character’s faith and patron and whether or not a covenant has been forged. Covenants may be pledged later in play.

## Step 5: Purchase equipment

Use the leftover number from Step 2\. The character begins the game with that many Pouches of Zimes \+1.

Characters are assumed to start with plain clothes.

# CHAPTER 4: EQUIPMENT

## 

## Encumbrance

The greatest gift given to the races of Psydonia was the ability to carry things; without the profound ability to pick objects up and bring them somewhere else, we would all be lost…

As an adventurer, you have a particular keen interest in carrying things (like weapons and treasure). To approximate the trouble of doing that, BUGCHUD uses a system of containers and carry slots.

### Containers

A character may have up to six containers \-- ranging from backpacks, to sacks, to holsters. A player will have to specify what containers are on their person.

The maximum number of containers a character can have is decreased based on their armor type, decreasing by one for every weight tier of armor (with a maximum of three containers with heavy armor.)

The kinds of things each container can carry is dependent upon the container itself; you’re not capable of storing apples inside a sword sheath. Just use common sense, and if you want to see if you can stuff something inside, ask your GM.

### Carry Slots

Each container on your person has three slots, no more and no less.

Items take up a number of slots relative to their size and weight. Slots cannot overlap into other containers. Particularly cumbersome or large things may not be stored in containers and may only be carried.

Items equipped do not take up slots.

1 slot: Small objects that are typically held with one hand. Lanterns, potions, daggers, goblets, ammo packs.

2 slots: Larger objects that are still held with a single hand. Shortswords, axes, scepters, grimoires.

3 slots: Large objects that need two hands to carry. Rifles, bows, greatswords, armor, small chests.

Unable to be stored: Objects too unwieldy or heavy to feasible store in a container. Large chests, halberds, flamethrowers.

Things that can feasibly be carried in a small pocket such as rings or small coins may be done so without regard for slots in reasonable amounts.

## Currency

Officially known as Mammons, but also referred to as Brouzoufs by old nostalgists, are coins minted and backed by the Shylock Cults of Psydonia. They are near universally accepted by all peoples and factions.

Mammons are referred to by the psy-symbol (Ψ), denoting anytime these coins are mentioned.

If a player is only in possession of a large amount of Mammons and wishes to buy something much cheaper than what they possess (say, a torch, while only having a pouch of Zimes), the player can simply obtain the item without regard for spending their coins (interpreted as taking a coin or two from the pouch to pay). This should be done in good taste and moderation, you don’t just get to buy 20,000 burgers because you have a bit of wealth on you.

### Amounts

#### Pouch

The smallest bundling of coins; a little bag. Takes up one carry slot.

#### Sack

Larger bag of coins. Four pouches make a sack. Takes up three carry slots.

#### Chest

Large chest of coins. Four sacks make a chest. Can only be carried.

### 

### Mammon Denominations

There are officially three denominations of Mammon-coins, though the shining glory of gemeralds has wormed their way into the pockets of the ultra-wealthy.

4 of a denomination is equivalent to the next. For instance; a Sack of Zennies is worth a pouch of Zickles, and a sack of Zickles is worth a Pouch of Zimes.

This sounds more complicated than it actually is, trust me; it’s simple. You’ll understand.

#### 

#### Zennies

Copper coins, which make up the majority of petty purchases and common wealth.

#### Zickles

Silver coins, the fortune of artisans and skilled laborers.

#### 

#### Zimes

Gold coins, the shining gleam that enchants the souls of nobles and marauders alike.

#### Gemmies

Shining little gemeralds, whose sparkle and exotic colors delight the affluent.

### Price-Tags

Rather than individual pricing of items and equipment, the GM will determine these prices by quickly consulting these price-tags, serving as rough estimates of value.

Basic  
*Pouch of Zennies*

Inexpensive goods and services. A simple bag, decent meal, a night at the inn, rope, gossip, etc.

Common  
*Pouch of Zickles, Sack of Zennies*

Specialized, yet still relatively inexpensive goods and services. Tools, bows, daggers, carriage rides, inexpensive armor, pistols, gnomes, etc.

Premium  
*Pouch of Zimes, Sack of Zickles, Chest of Zennies*

Crafted equipment and luxuries, along with low-end SCOM tech. Swords, spears, good quality armor, a horse, a bribe, radios, rifles, etc.

Superior  
*Pouch of Gemmies, Sack of Zimes, Chest of Zickles*

Magical or high-tech equipment and goods. Laser-tech, bionics, grimoire pages, potions, low-end vehicles.

masterwork  
*Sack of Gemmies, Chest of Zimes*

Extremely valuable magic or high-tech items. Complete grimoires, tanks, boats, holy artifacts, enchanted weapons.

### Shylock Terminals

Various SCOM machines across the land, bearing the visage of an old demon of greed. The metal clad boxes themselves are known as Shylock Terminals (for their organization’s namesake), but they’re often just referred to as Shylocks.

Shylocks can be fed treasure through their mouth ports, which will then spit out mammon-coins of relevant value.

If you are overburdened by riches, Shylock terminals will store your wealth for a fee. This fee is typically 25% of the total Mammon value of coins deposited (IE, if I deposit a Sack of Zimes, I will lose a Pouch of Zimes in value). This fee does not apply to amounts totalling less than a Sack of Zennies.

Shylock terminals can smell greed. Do not try to outsmart one; if a depositor attempts to piecemeal their coins to avoid fees, the machine will taste more than coins soon enough.

*GREED IS GOOD.*

## Weapons and Their Stats

You’re going to want to keep these close in Psydonia, so read carefully on the virtues of bullets and iron.

### Universal Weapon Stats

Below is a list of stats that all weapons have, regardless of whether they are simple sharpened sticks or fully automatic machine guns.

#### Weight

How heavy the weapon is, and therefore, how much damage it does when a hit connects.

Light weapons roll 2d6 and keep the lower roll.  
Medium weapons roll 1d6.  
Heavy weapons roll 2d6 and keep the higher roll.

### Ranged Weapon Stats

These stats are for all those weapons that kill from afar, whether that be from a whistling arrow, or the screaming death of an automatic rifle.

#### Range (RNG)

Effective range of the weapon. Beyond this, the weapon can’t hit its target.

#### Accuracy (ACC)

Successes required to hit your target.

#### Ammo Dice (AD)

Maximum amount of extra dice that can be added to the weapon’s Twitch check.

For more information, seek the Ammo Dice section in the Combat Rules chapter.

# CHAPTER 5: VEHICLES & MOUNTS

*I am company commander Blackard of the 55th Zizoid Armored Brigades, and we have never known defeat. My platoon is tracked death rolling.*

## 

## Vehicles

Automobiles and armored transports, often associated with menacing Elvish raiding parties and the deadliest weapons of the Inhumen Crisis. However, as the years have dragged on since the near-apocalypse, their use has disseminated throughout Psydonia, and the stereotype has lessened.

*CombuSTION creations, who crawl and roll from the Darklands – Zizo had given the knowledge of pistons and gasoline back to Elvenkind.*

## 

### Vehicle Stats

## 

#### Size

How easy it is for ranged attacks to hit the vehicle. The larger a vehicle is, the more bonus dice are granted when firing upon it.

Small; no change.  
Medium; \+1D  
Large; \+2D

#### Chassis

How many wound points it takes for a vehicle to be disabled.

Light; 1 Soak. 🗲3 Wound Points to disable.  
Medium; 2 Soaks. 🗲4 Wound Points to disable.  
Heavy; 3 Soaks. 🗲5 Wound Points to disable.

#### Gas Mileage

At the end of each day of travel, roll d6 dice equal to the vehicle’s Gas Mileage stat. If a 1 turns up, the vehicle is out of fuel and must be refueled.

#### Occupants

How many characters can realistically fit inside the vehicle. More can hang onto the side

#### Speed

How far a vehicle moves during combat.

## Vehicle List

### Vehicle List

| *Vehicle* | *Size* | *Chassis* | *Gas Mileage* | *Occupants* | *Speed* |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Jeep | Medium | Light | 1 | 4 | 20ft |
| Tank | Large | Heavy | 3 | 5 | 15ft |

#### Jeep

Exotic motor-carriage. Rare outside of the Darklands.

#### Tank

Treaded metal beast. Often used by Darkland city states in skirmishes against one another.

Armed with a Cannon and Emplacement Gun, both of which must be manned by passengers.

## Mounts

Certain beasts of burden and domesticated animals may be ridden around Psydonia. This could be galloping horses or sinister beasts of far more exotic origin.

These animals are treated as NPCs, and obviously do not roll for gas mileage.

# CHAPTER 7: BIONICS

## 

## Bionics

The Darklands are home to disturbing technologies, being the origin of SCOM devices and advanced weaponry – but the most infamous among these creations are bionics. Many Elves native to the city-states are equipped with a host of cybernetic enhancements; closer to walking machines than a living creatures, who often terrify with their clicking servos and sparking wires.

Bionics are becoming more prevalent beyond the curse-stained heathen-lands, with metal-sewn bounty hunters, merchants and warriors passing through towns being an increasingly more common sight.

*ZIZO SHORNED her own USE OF CYBERNETICS; her kouncil were of all manner copper, steel and lead – but she alone was pale flesh.*

## 

| Surgery Code | Surgery Damage |
| :---: | :---: |
| Minor | 1d4 |
| Major | 2d4 |
| Critical | 3d4 |

## Installation

In order to bind oneself to bionic enhancements, you will need to find or hire someone capable of installing them.

Surgery is nasty business, however, and depending on how extensive of a modification the cybernetic is, you’ll receive damage during installation. This is referred to as the Surgery’s Code.

### Maintenance and Malfunction

Each cybernetic must be maintained to prevent catastrophic malfunction. At the end of each day, or when activating a bionic’s ability, you’ll roll from what is known as the Maintenance die for each bionic – representing mechanical wear and tear. On a roll of 1 or 2, it degrades to the next die, seen below;

d10 \-\> d8 \-\> d6 \-\> d4

If a d4 dice degrades – the bionic malfunctions. Make a save vs death – on a failure, receive an agonizing death. A faulty wire catches fire in the ribcage, or a servo-motor pierces the brain, a robotic arm seizes and punches its own user to death – whatever happens, it’s lethal and it’s ugly. 

If the save is successful, you survive, but the bionic is broken for the time being – and if it’s something like specialized eyes or a replacement limb, you’ll have to go without them for the time being.

Bionics require regular upkeep by specialized mechanics who don't work cheap. For every maintenance dice increase, it will cost roughly a Pouch of Zickles.

### Salvaging Bionics

Whenever a bionic is ripped from the cold corpse of a cyborg, roll 1d4 to determine its maintenance level;

4: d10  
3: d8  
2: d6  
1: d4

## 

## Bionics list

A non-exhaustive list of the cybernetic modifications found in Psydonia. The GM is encouraged to create their own metallic abominations.

Bionics in Bugchud are obscene and over the top. There are no limits on how many someone can have – characters can jam as many as they want on, and if two or more bionics replace the same body part, that works too..

Allows the user of this bionic to jump about 10ft once per day.

#### \[Fear Suppression\]

Brain sections associated with fear responses are dissolved and wired, leaving the user incredibly difficult to scare.

\+10 to saves vs Fear.

#### 

#### \[Nerve stapling\] 

Cutting nonessential brain sections diminishes the subject’s intelligence greatly, but leaves them open to suggestion. 

Victim is left incredibly suggestible at the cost of severe brain damage.

#### \[Psychokinetic Frequency Coils\]

A myriad of wires, vents, and metal plates are stabbed into the skull, focusing the ability to command black magick. 

User may activate this bionic to restore 1d6 MD. Flip a coin \- on tails, receive that many Wound Points as well.

A potent explosive is implanted into the abdomen.

Once the user dies, the dead switch activates \-- causing a short range explosion (2d6 damage)

#### 

#### \[Necromantic subroutines\]

Arcane SCOM tech leaves the user in perpetual unlife.

User cannot die.

# 

# CHAPTER 8: MUTATION

## Xom

The unstable magick and mutation of the world is known as Xom, a scourge upon all wizards and the curse of mutants.

Characters may accrue Xom Points any number of ways, the most common of which are as follows:

* Casting spells.  
* Traveling through Xom stained areas.  
* Magical objects.  
* Potions.

Every permanent point of Xom grants \+1 MD. However, should a character reach 10+ permanent points of Xom, they will die an agonizing death.

*Zizo poisoned the world’s mana in the closing days of the Inhumen crisis – the Black Day, leaving vast swathes of the world desolate.*

### Mutation Rolls

At the end of each day, roll a number of d6 die equal to the amount of Xom you’ve accumulated that day. For every dice that rolls a 1, the victim gains a permanent point of Xom and rolls on the d1000 mutation table. Otherwise, the Xom dissipates.

For every mutation, receive \+1 Permanent Xom.

If rolling for mutation, and you land on a mutation you already have, reroll.

## How do I get rid of mutations?

For the majority of mutations, getting rid of them is quite difficult. 

Some are able to be sliced off by surgeons or perfumers, while others can only be cured by magical means.

Whatever the case may be, should one remove a mutation, they will also remove a permanent point of Xom.

# CHAPTER 9: MAGICK OF PSYDONIA

*I was terrified, \- for in the cloaked man’s hands, \- in ebon majesty, beheld a terrible, crackling black magick; behold, a wizard\!* 

## 

## Magick

Once a benign and passive study \- resembling natural philosophy, the study of Magick & Mana was forever changed when Zizo spilled her cursed blood into the worldweave. An event that shook the foundations of reality \- birthing the first black magick.

Now, magick is a transformative, destructive force, sought by sinister warlocks and mad-men – thus, it is an art often mastered by men and women with grandeurs of power, willing to do whatever it takes, no matter how scarred they may become.

Most wizards seclude themselves in crumbling towers that blight the land of Psydonia, pouring over forgotten scrolls and books. They occasionally launch pillage raids against other, perceivably weaker wizards to seize their grimoires and magical artifact, all while cultivating a mass of obedient underlings to enact their will.

## Grimoires and Memorizing Spells

A Grimoire is a wizard’s collected tome of magick spells and rites. If you have a spell in your grimoire, you can cast it \- so long as you recite the spell from the book itself (this will mean literally holding and reading the book in combat)

If a Grimoire is lost or destroyed, all of the spells held within are lost as well.

### Copying Spells

Whenever a wizard uncovers a new spell, the wizard may copy its contents into their own personal Grimoire.

## 

## Mana Dice

To cast a spell, you’ll need Mana Dice (MD). MD is your natural fuel for casting spells. It is black magick made manifest.

### Mana Regeneration

At the end of each day, restore all MD.

## 

## Casting Spells

When casting a spell, you’ll spend MD for a number of d6 dice to roll. 

The power of the spell is dependent on how many dice are rolled when casting it. The result of each individual die determines what happens after you cast the spell. These are considered Mojo rolls, so the Mojo attribute’s loyalty bonuses or detriments are applied.

Failure; The MD spent is lost.  
Success; MD spent is refunded and retained.

*O’ terrible rite… Grant me might…*

### MD Dice Application

As already covered, MD are used to power spells. However, different spells use different methods of harnessing MD. Consult the terminology below.

#### \[Dice\]

Number of MD spent.

*Example: 3 MD spent. Number used is 3\.*	

#### \[Sum\]

Total sum of the MD’s rolled.

*Example: MD rolls of 2, 4, 5\. Number used is 11\.*

#### \[Best of\]

Highest result among MD rolled.

*Example: MD rolls of 2, 4, 5\. Number used is 5\.*

### Mana-Burn

When casting a spell, for every natural dice roll of 1 (a 1 before any bonuses or detriments are added), the caster gains a point of Xom. 

This can be mitigated a number of ways, such as use of a staff when casting spells.

*There is nobody, save for the oldest Elves, who remember a time when mana did not cackle with malice.*

# CHAPTER 10: ALCHEMY

*Mix stir mix stir…*

## 

## What is Alchemy?

Alchemy is the practiced, not-so-scientific art of magical materials and chemistry.

Spells are bottled or powdered into liquid or solids respectively, waiting for foolish adventurers to snort or drink them.

### Potency

Potions and powders will have ‘+x’ at the beginning of their names. This is Potency. It is how many dice are rolled upon ingesting the alchemical product, determining its power \- like artificial MD, including the risk for taking on Xom.

*For example, I drink a \+5 Potion of Healing. I heal 5 wound points, but I’ll need to roll 5 dice \- rolls of 1 incur \+1 Xom.*

### Potions & Powders

Alchemical products are either potions or powders.

Potions may be thrown with a Medium range onto a target to shatter and trigger the potion’s effect. 

Powders receive \+1 Potency.

Both immediately activate after being ingested. They don’t give you a free cast of the spell, they simply activate the potion’s effect. Drinking a Potion of Fireball \+6 won’t let you sling it, it’ll just detonate in your gut.

## Brewing

To create your own alchemical products, you need the relevant training or background. 

If you possess the relevant training, you’ll need to have the original spell on hand via a grimoire. Pay a pouch of zennies for each point of potency. It will take an hour to create per point of potency.

# CHAPTER 11: FAITHS OF PSYDONIA

*Hark\! For the moment has come\! The world unravels, and the imperfect creator is brought to his knees \-- terror, Psydon\! Zizo comes\!*

## 

## The Gods of Psydonia

One could mistake the land of Psydonia for being God forsaken \- on the contrary, the Gods of Psydonia take an active part in its troubles and triumphs

## Covenant

To personally vow an oath of loyalty to a deity is known as Covenant. It is to sign your soul in service to their labors and campaign, and is not done lightly. In return for subservience, the deity will grant their follower boons and blessings.

## 

## Zealotry

Whenever petitioning a God for assistance, make a Save vs Zealotry. Failure means the fickle God has found you lacking in devotion, and refuses to grant you power.

Ways to increase Zealotry:

* Cultist robes (+2)  
* Ritual tattoos or scarring (+1)  
* Iconography (symbols on shields, tabard, etc) (+1)  
* Screaming praise (+1)  
* Consistent behaviors, such as abstinence or willing poverty (+1)

This list is not definitive. The more fanatic your devotion, the better.

### Canticle Debt

The Gods expect power to be repaid with acts of service. It’s gained one of two ways:

* Whenever a save vs Zealotry is failed (+1 Canticle Debt)  
* Acting contrary to the deity’s principles or beliefs (+2 Canticle Debt)

Characters subtract from their Zealotry save equal to the amount of Canticle Debt they have.

To rid oneself of Canticle Debt, a character should engage in acts of worship or veneration. Each deity would prefer different acts of worship. Prayer and charity would please Astrata, self scarification and ritual cannibalism would please Graggar.

It can also be rid of by advancing the faith, either through proselytization or the destruction of heathens and heretics.

If a character reaches 10 Canticle Debt and does not repay their God in a timely manner, the covenant is considered broken OR the character may become a heretic.

## Gifts of the Covenant

Those who forge covenants receive the blessings and power of their deity. Below are the tools at the devout’s disposal.

### 

### Incantations

At the beginning of each day, the GM will grant a covenant member access to a small selection of spells. These are incantations – powers granted by a God for use in the endless crusade against all manner of heretics and heathens.

Rather than using MD to cast these spells, a character will declare a number and then make that many saves vs Zealotry. The spell is cast with power equal to the number of successful saves made.

*For example, at the start of the day, Astrata grants me the Healing spell. Later on, I find a wounded man – and I attempt to cast the Healing spell with 4 saves. I make 4 saves vs Zealotry – 3 are successes. I cast the spell with a power of 3\.*

If the spell effect requires the sum total of dice, roll d6 dice equal to the number of successful checks. Otherwise, no need to roll.

They may only be used to enact the will of the deity. No using Astratan god-powers to vaporize orphans.

If a character is unhappy with the repertoire of spells, they may make a sacrifice or offering and pray – but there is no guarantee it will work.

### Relics

Objects of esteemed importance in the faith. They can be remnants from the Inhumen Crisis, body-parts of the God’s mortal forms, or any other variety of holy object.

Relics give access to spells or abilities so long as the user is a member of the associated deity’s covenant.

### Miracles

An appeal to divinity, often made in desperation.

Characters may ask their God for anything \- the only restriction being that it should make sense for that deity to grant and that it is feasibly within their power.

To call upon a miracle, save vs Zealotry a number of times equal to the miracle’s assigned difficulty. If every save vs Zealotry is successful, the miracle is enacted. If any are failed, the miracle fizzles.

Unlike other saves vs Zealotry, \+1 Canticle debt is received even for successful saves.

#### Miracle Difficulties

Inconsequential miracle (1 save): wine to water, walking on water.

Easy miracle (2 saves): curing illness or disability, guidance.

Difficult miracle (3 saves): blessing a weapon, clearing weather.

Very difficult miracle (4 saves): smiting a heathen, grand display of power, creating a relic.

Legendary miracle (5 saves): blotting out the sun temporarily, calling upon locusts, bringing someone back to life.

## Apostasy and Heresy

If a covenant is broken between a follower and their deity, they will have two options;

* Abandon the faith in shame. Never again will their God assist them, and followers of the betrayed deity will be hostile.  
* Turn towards heresy. Canticle Debt will be reset to 0\. The follower must elaborate on their heresy both in and out of character, describing its differing beliefs in doctrines. 

Heresies of minor theological difference will be viewed by more traditional followers as a mistake that needs correcting, typically by debate or stern warning. More extreme diversions will provoke violence in the faithful.

Those who create a heresy can only abandon the faith, not create another heresy. (No heresies of heresies, for gameplay sake.)

## The Immortal Eight

The most common faith in Psydonia, the veneration of the Immortal Eight has remained firm for one thousand years. Adherents believe that Pysdon’s death ushered in an age of immortal mortality, where a once forbidden divinity was passed onto new hands.

Worship of the Gods is sanctioned by the Immortal Church, who maintains theological orthodoxy. However, heresies and more extreme teachings prosper under cover of night-time festivals and more far flung frontiers.

Likely worshippers: non-elves, nobles and commoners alike.

*Long ago, five mortals laid down their lives to stop evil from destroying this world. Five Gods were born from their memory – and three more to mend the natural cycles.*

*Eight deities, entrusted to a world not meant for them.*

### Abyssor

Immortal God of the sea, aquatic life and deals. Abyssor offers gifts to those willing to pay his prices.

Likely worshippers: sailors, the superstitious and pirates.

Boon of worship: breathe underwater for 2d10 extra minutes per day.  
Boon of covenant: Abyssor awaits you – come, enjoy the taste of brine.

Symbols: fish, salt and lightning

*Friend of all sailors and deep-sea creatures, Abyssor guards against raging typhoons and storms in exchange for worship and sacrifice.*

*Many men are tempted to pay his prices for more, the so-called taste of brine \- only to be wracked with scales and gills to dwell in his cold domain evermore.*

#### Pouch of Fine Salt

Pouch of finest salt, much too pristine for use in food or preservation. Many sailors keep their salt close in hopes that it will spare them wracking storms.

*Abyssor’s waves batter ships not out of rage, but out of a profound loneliness.*

*For it is said that he resides alone in the ocean; and to drag men down to him is his only respite.*

#### shell of a Sea-creecher

Misshapen and strange looking shell, evidently once the home of one of Abyssor’s many children. They are seen as good omens by Abyssorites when they wash ashore.

*Beneath the waves lies an entire world unseen. That which dwells in the waters is surely alien.*

*But life, even monstrous, slimy life – is still life, and to Abyssorites, they are holy.*

### Astrata

Immortal Goddess of virtue, nobility and the sun. Leader of the Immortal Eight.

Likely worshippers: farmers, zealots, and nite-creecher hunters.

Boon of worship: may reroll any save vs Zealotry once to resist nite-creecher powers.  
Boon of covenant: may reroll any save vs Fear once.

Symbols: the sun, spears, shields  and golden crowns

*Radiant and pure, Astrata is known as the great unifier.*

*Astrata sacrificed herself to end the Inhumen Crisis, blotting out the dark-star with a spear of pure sunlight. For this reason, the sun is venerated as not just a symbol of Astrata, but her very being.*

### Shard of the soldered Shield

Piece of the shield carried by Astrata. Upon an enemy’s surrender, she broke off the tip of their blade and grafted it upon her shield.

*Astrata was tasked with stopping Zizo, to end the iNHUMEN monstrosity before it can truly be born.*

*jOURNEYING nORTH, SHE DIDN’T FIND THE WITCH-QUEEN; BUT A WOUNDED rAVOX, HOWLING raging and spitting curses.*

Prism of The old sun  
Great shard of glass, which holds the gleaming light of the old sun. Astrata treasured one just like this as a reminder of better days.

*When she beheld the old sun in her hands, she knew it would never return – but it didn’t matter.*

*For it is hope that lights the hearts of men.*

### Silver Face

Silver medallion bearing the visage of a weeping holy man. Silver is the metal that scourged Kain from this world, so it retains a symbolic significance to nite-creecher hunters.

*Astrata had known Kain long before his descent towards madness. She once considered him close.*

*She slew him not out of hatred, but as a mercy.*

### Ravox

Immortal God of heroism, glory, combat and redemption. It was by Ravox’s sword that the world was saved.

Likely worshippers: justice-seekers, mercenaries, and honor-bound warriors.

Boon of worship: Reroll any save vs physique once per day.  
Boon of covenant: receive advantage in melee combat checks against Inhumen worshippers.

Symbols: ravens, swords and scales of justice.

*A mercenary and cutthroat in life, Ravox found redemption through bloody affair.*

*Ravox suffered mortal wounds during his final battle with Graggar. Courageously, he used the last of his life to skewer the Inhumen beast and end him, giving Astrata the opportunity to blot out the dark-star.*

*A debt repaid.*

Bone of Oyu  
Piece of bone from Ravox’s horse. Ravox considered Oyu not just his steed, but a close companion.

*As Ravox lay dying, his last thoughts were of those nights spent riding under moonlight – he, Graggar, Eora.*

*They were the happiest nights of his life.*

Shard of the Raven-Helm  
Piece of the original raven-helm, whose visage awed those who looked upon it. Its metal is twisted and bent, mangled by Graggar.

*Ravox witnessed with his own eyes the death of Eora – every grisly thud of Graggar’s mace upon her head.*

*By the time it was over, Ravox’s voice was hoarse and ragged from his rage – and he swore vengeance.*

Saber Icon  
Small emblem depicting a curved blade. Ravox worshippers are fond of all steel, but the cavalry saber is particularly favored.

*The cruel steppes push men towards survival, not morality \-- a fact that Ravox knew all too well.*

*The blood he shed made him infamous, a scourge upon the Southern realms.*

### Dendor

Immortal God of the wild, animals and unbound primalism. Those with nothing left often turn to the woods, and there, Dendor is waiting.

Likely worshippers: hermits, sentient beasts and madmen.

Boon of worship: find comfort in the wild, rest anywhere with no issue.  
Boon of covenant: animals understand your words.

Symbols: no identifiable symbols, save for crude effigies and idols depicting Dendor.

*Faith in Dendor harkens back to a primordial prehistory, where there was no ability among beasts to appreciate such simplicity in intelligent design.*

*Dendor’s only wish is for the peoples of Psydonia is to return to a more natural existence \- where one is at peace to hunt and be hunted, with the only virtue being the clever guile of naked bodies and sprinting predators. Eat, reproduce, die.*

#### Petrified Wood Face

Smiling face of a mad-man, made eternal by creeping tree bark. This is the desired fate of all who praise the good Dendor.

*To give yourself to the forests of Psydonia is a wonderful thing. None regret their choice.*

*There is no such thing as a weeping tree.*

#### Paw of a Cabbit

Severed paw of a cabbit, a Dendor blessed mixture of rabbit and feline. They are venerated by Dendorites as examples of the majesty of nature, and there is no sweeter flesh to partake in.

### 

*And the Good Dendor said; let there be Cabbits.*

#### Discard idol

Mess of mud and small twigs given the crude shape of a goat-man. Dendorites often keep these idols close to emulate companionship.

*Many Dendorites are not born into the faith. rather, they are called by great tragedy or loss into the forests.*

*It is a privilege to live unseen; to die and be forgotten.*

### Eora

Immortal Goddess of love, home and memories. Those who pray for mercy pray to Eora.

Likely worshippers: doting grandmothers, romantics and the innocent.

Boon of worship: by touch, understand emotions \-- feel their pain, feel their sorrow.  
Boon of covenant: always know the path home, wherever that may be.

Symbols: hearts, tears, doves and bows.

*Gentle and loving, Eora was the first to fall.*

*Once the bride of Graggar, she grew disgusted with his descent towards villainy and abandoned her vows. When Ravox refused Zizo’s gift of godhood, Eora joined him on the journey home.* 

*Enraged, Graggar wounded Ravox and killed Eora. It was her memory that kept guilt wracked Ravox going.*

#### Fabric of the Bridal Gown

Shredded piece of the dress Eora wore on her wedding day to Graggar. Despite centuries of age, the cloth is still pristine.

*Even through years of marriage, Graggar never laid with Eora and they produced no children.*

*Deep down, Eora knew that his love was elsewhere.*

#### Blessed Drawstring

Drawstring of an old cavalry bow, dipped in the blood of a yak. Bows are considered symbols of Eora not out of martial prowess, but for the love she gave to her brother.

*Six years his elder, gentle Eora protected Ravox as a child, hunting game both small and large alike to feed them both.*

*It would have been easier for her to abandon the child, to leave his life for her own; but she never considered it.*

#### Heart Medallion

It is believed that Eora had worn a medallion just like this one; a silver locket with a pale pink heart. Her worship is maintained through this imitation.

*Eora confided in her brother; that Godhood is a curious thing, and that the flesh and bone that we are is what makes us whole.*

*Without her words and tender love, Ravox would have gone down a darker path.*

#### 

### Malum

Immortal God of craft, duty and family. Father of dwarf-kind. Masterworks and perfect labors are said to be invoked by Malum.

Likely worshippers: dwarves, artists, laborers and tradesmen.

Boon of worship: reroll any save vs Fear once per day.  
Boon of covenant: never die from fright \-- for there is nothing to fear.

Symbols: anvils, hammers, crucibles and fine gems.

*When Astrata approached Malum and shared with him her mission, he accepted. A life long lived, and his family gone \- what use was a man like he if he couldn’t help save the world?*

*For seven restless days and nights, Malum forged the spear of pure sunlight. Only upon the dawn of the seventh day, did the sunrise gleam upon the spear, and he could die in peace.*

### Xylix

Immortal God of tricks, pranks and games. Father of halfling-kind. Xylix is the patron saint of the fool in all of us.

Likely worshippers: gamblers, thieves, rogues and jesters.

Boon of worship: may reroll any Twitch check involving sleight of hand.  
Boon of covenant: always slightly better odds when gambling.

Symbols: cards, dice and daggers.

*The apprentice of Malum in mortal life \- he never took to smithing, preferring to play cards and live carefree and young.*

*It was Xylix who tricked Matthios in a game of wits, binding the inhumen beast’s destiny by will of a golden serpent. In fury, Matthios stuck Xylix’s heart with a dagger.* 

*his final thoughts were of how proud Malum would be of him.*

### Necra

Immortal Goddess of death, burials and the afterlife. Without Necra, the death-tide would drown the world in rot. 

Likely worshippers: mourners, the macabre and those near death.

Boon of worship: may reroll a save vs magic once per day.  
Boon of covenant: perform the rites of Necra on the deceased, ensuring their soul is led upon the right path in the afterlife.

Symbols: black standards, candles, scythes and skull and bones.

*Necra shepherds the souls of the dead to a kinder place, where they await the mending of the cycle in silent reflection.*

*Those who reject Necra’s offer or become lost along the way will have their soul destroyed \- but to worshippers of the Inhumen, this was their mission all along.*

#### Ritual Skull

Pristine skull of a holy-man.

#### Scythe Icon

Emblem depicting a raised scythe. Necrans do not view death with fear; it is merely the next step in the process of life.

*Deprived of reincarnation, one must be at peace with the idea of eternity.*

*Those who scorn the Gods can never accept such imprisonment.*

#### Ferryman’s Coin

Old coin of unknown origin, bearing the image of a kindly looking skeleton. Necrans believe these are from the world after this one.

*It is the rigid belief of Necrans that the soul will be met by the ferryman on the river Gyx, and that the only price he asks for is an iron coin.*

*How kind he is, to protect the eternal soul in exchange for something so small.*

## The Old Faith

The original faith of humenity. Adherents to the Old Faith are radicals even by Psydonian standards. They espouse a violent monotheism that rejects both the Immortal Eight as pagan idols and the Inhumen Pantheon as traitors and animals. They will not rest until Psydon is restored.

Likely worshippers: humen supremacists and chauvinists.

*Faith in Psydon is still checkered among the lands of Psydonia \- whose rabid monotheism reminds many of where humenity’s loyalty once lied.*

*Perhaps it is nostalgia for greatness that compels men and women to maintain the worship of a dead God?*

### Psydon

True God-King of man, emissary of the pantokrator.

Likely worshippers: fanatics, heretics and nostalgists.

Boon of worship: N/A  
Boon of covenant: N/A

Symbols: the immortal psycross.

*He who turned the wine to water and blinded the faithless, the true God-King of mankind.*

*His corpse parts lay scattered across the land. it is the ambition of all Psydonites to reunite his flesh; to herald the second coming.*

#### Old Psycross

Rugged iron symbol of Psydon forged during his rule. To those who still worship the god-king, it brings a comfort not found elsewhere.

*Few remember Psydon’s rule, only the stories of past glories.*

*Those who do remember, remember wonders.*

#### Piece of the Godly Throne

Chunk of stone taken from Psydon’s throne. It is said that even as Graggar’s orcs destroyed this symbol of tyranny, they basked in its glory.

*Even as he lay wounded by black magick, Psydon called Zizo and her followers looters, undeserving of his station.*

*His breath was heavy; he didn’t know he could die. It felt strange to him.*

#### Tattered standard

Shriveled flag, bearing forgotten symbols and iconography alien to the modern onlooker. It is evidently from a time even before Psydon, likely taken as a trophy.

*The God-King’s Jihad was merciless, a scouring of the world; to be remade in his image.*

*For this, Elf-kind would never forgive him.*

## The Inhumen Pantheon

Sinister faith of heathens and apostates, only openly espoused in the darklands. Inhumen worshippers believe in the Age of Dissolution \- a coming era where the world is brought to violent conclusion, whereupon the blind pantokrator will be forced to rejoin the natural cosmos.

Likely worshippers: elves, cultists and those forsaken by the eight.

*When Zizo learned the truth of creation, a voice from behind the moon whispered to her secrets both great and small.*

*From these revelations, the seeds of dissolution were planted.*

*Three mortals, to strike down the godhead. World-enders.*

### Graggar, the Dark-Star

Inhumen God of cruelty, murder and conquest. Graggar only believes in primitive brutality and acts of violence.

Likely followers: murderers, the cruel and orcs.

Boon of worship: ability to eat raw flesh and organs without issue.  
Boon of covenant: \+1 Flesh. Immunity to the Red Grin.

Symbols: the dark-star, cicadas and bloodied gore.

*Once Ravox’s sworn comrade, Graggar was driven to petty vengeance against a man he once considered his brother.*

*It was by Graggar’s hand that the sun was blotted from the sky \- the dark-star, a symbol of not just Graggar, but the Inhumen’s tyranny.*

#### Shred of Maille

Piece of chainmaille said to have been worn by Graggar. The iron is cold, and never warms.

*No matter the icy rains, no matter the scorching heat – no matter the weapons of their enemies, Graggar never faltered in his oath.*

*When Ravox turned his back on him, his nightmares were realized.*

#### Banner of the Dark-Star

Cloth flag depicting the dark-star; whose grinning face and tendrils parody the true light.

*Years of resentment, of jealousy and frustration, came surging forward.*

*If he would not be loved, he would settle for hatred.*

#### Old Cicada Shell

Shell of a cicada dipped in wax. The song of cicadas made Graggar feel safe, as it reminded him of home. His followers don’t care for things of the sort.

*He steeled himself and left to rejoin Zizo. tHE song OF CICADAS WAS HIS ONLY COMPANy ALONG THE PATH.*

*The glory of vengeance quickly faded, replaced with regret.*

### Comrade Matthios

Inhumen God of revolution, the poor and chaos. Matthios teaches that only through class conflict can social woes be alleviated.

Likely followers: downtrodden peasants, revolutionaries, the envious and bandits.

Boon of worship: identify other Matthios worshippers by looking into their eyes \- the sight of comrades.  
Boon of covenant: \+1 Twitch.

Symbols: hammer and scythe, dragons and grinning teeth

*In life, Matthios championed justice. In Godhood, however, his virtue had revealed itself as envious hatred.*

*Matthios was defeated by the mortal Xylix, who binded his fate in a game of wits \- a curse upon the Inhumen God, who will only be freed when the golden serpent is fed his due.*

#### Black Cloth Fragment

Fabric ripped from Matthios’ black cloak. Although many assume he wore it to aid in skulking, its true purpose was to hide away his deformities.

*Matthios was a master of his craft, there was no finer pickpocket or burglar.*

*He was the first among the party to know Zizo’s true plan \- Godhood? Now \*that\* was a score.*

#### Lousy Gemerald

Ever greedy, Matthios fashioned fake jewels such as this to pawn. Freemen often create their own to parody the absurdity of wealth itself.

*To this day, Matthios languishes; constricted by the golden serpent, who will release its grip when it is fed its due.*

*For when the serpent gorges its last coin and chokes, shall the bandit-saint once more walk among man.*

#### Bloodied Silk

Shred of fine silk from a noble-woman’s dress, likely taken as a trophy during the Inhumen Crisis. The embroidered designs faded, but the blood never dried.

*Psydon’s death weighed heavy not just upon the world-weave, but the social fabric of the empire. When the news reached the masses, violence followed.*

*For the nobleman and his frail daughters had no-one left to protect them.*

### Zizo

Inhumen God of black magick, ambition and the undead. Zizo desires only one thing; to destroy this world to make way for a new one.

Likely followers: elves, nihilists and wizards.

Boon of worship: May re-roll any spell-cast once.  
Boon of covenant: \+1 Mojo

Symbols: eyes, butterflies and the moon

*Zizo discovered the hidden secrets of creation and vowed to end the pantokrator’s grip on reality, a process only possible by complete destruction of the universe.*

*When the Dark-Star was torn from the sky, Zizo knew that her plan had failed. As final testament to her desire for new beginnings, she mustered all of her being into a terrible curse upon herself, and threw herself into the world’s mana.*

#### Cursed finger

Shriveled finger of an old crone, pulsing with black magick. Zizo was not alone in her labors, and warlocks from the world over travelled to serve her.

*Despite the icy chill of her character, Zizo could not help but smile at a good plan coming together.*

#### Wings of a butterfly

Wings of vivid purple hue contained in a small glass vial. It is said that as Zizo unraveled, butterflies surrounded her.

*Wrapped in her cocoon of curses, she changed into something she thought was beautiful.*

*Even as her body dissolved, she was happy.*

#### Scroll Fragment of the End Times

A sliver of Zizo’s manifesto, which details her justifications for the apocalypse. The ink is faded and indecipherable.

*When the voice behind the moon first spoke to Zizo, she was frightened; for It spoke of the end of all things.*

*In time, however, Zizo considered it not just her guiding moonlight, but a close friend.*

# 

# CHAPTER 12: COMBAT RULES

*I LIKE MURDER AND KILLING PEOPLE\!*

## 

## Combat Turns

Each character can do up to one ‘thing’ during a combat turn (not counting movement), including but not limited to swinging swords, aiming rifles, flicking levers, drinking potions or anything else that takes up a not-insignificant amount of time.

After which, they will pass their turn to the next person in the queue as decided beforehand (unless it’s the GM, in which case, NPCs can proceed however they wish.)

## Initiative

When combat begins, the GM will determine the initiative of players and NPCs. This will determine if anyone is caught off-guard.

If hostilities are mutual or expected, nobody is caught by surprise – both sides are expecting a fight, and they’re about to get one. Players will decide amongst themselves the order in which they find themselves in

However, if the victim of an ambush or some sort of surprise attack, each character will make a 3S+ Twitch check to determine if they’ve lost initiative. If initiative is lost, the character is completely unable to act during their first turn of combat.

## Range

Range in Bugchud is abstracted into vaguely defined zones. It’s the GM’s burden to determine where characters and NPCs are relative to each other. These zones determine the effective ranges of things like weapons and spells.

Refer to the chart on the right to determine what zone of range a character might fall under.

## Soaks

To avoid damage, armor will provide a stat called Soaks (the damage was soaked\!).

## 

### Melee Attacks vs Soaks

When in melee combat, a character must roll Flesh and attain a number of successes exceeding their opponent’s Soaks, after which, damage is rolled for. If the successes aren’t higher than Soaks, the attack glances off of the armor.

*For example, if my character is swung at with a battleaxe, and my attacker achieves 3 successes while I have 3 soaks, nothing happens \-- the blow doesn’t hit, and no damage is rolled for.*

### Ranged Attacks vs Soaks

Soaks act differently in ranged combat compared to melee combat, instead offering flat damage reduction against bullets or arrows.

| Range | Description |
| :---: | :---: |
| Close range | Melee distance \- close enough to speak somewhat quietly. |
| Short Range | Too far apart for melee, close enough to hold a somewhat loud conversation. Can “see the whites in their eyes” |
| Medium Range | Far enough that shouting is needed for combatants to hear each other. Inability to make out small details on combatants. |
| Long Range | Combatants can see each other, but cannot communicate without radio or other aid. Too far apart to close the distance in a short amount of time. |
| Extreme Range | Combatants can barely see each other and cannot meaningfully interact. Combat is effectively impossible. |

*For example, if my character is shot for 4 damage, and they are wearing heavy armor (3 soaks), he will only take 1 damage.*

## Locational Hits

When a character attacks, before rolling to attack; roll 1d10 to determine what body part is struck. (seen below).

1-5) Torso  
6\) Right arm  
7\) Left arm  
8\) Right leg  
9\) Left leg  
10\) Head

If a target has extra limbs of the kind targeted, choose the one damaged at random.

### Limb Loss

If a character takes 4 or more Wound Points in a single hit to an arm or leg AND they have no more Bones to absorb Wound Points, then the limb struck has been crippled, cut off, or destroyed.

A lost limb will need to be replaced; either with bionic prosthetics or some kind of healing magic.

#### What Happens When I Lose an Arm?

If an arm is lost, you don’t get to use it anymore, duh. No holding weapons, no holding shields, and especially no playing the piano.

#### What Happens When I Lose a Leg?

If one or both legs are lost, you are unable to move and are knocked prone.

## Melee Combat

In order to attack with swords or clubs, a character will make a Flesh check, requiring a total number of successes that are equal to or exceed their victim’s Soak stat (this is different depending on if the head or body/limbs are struck.)

If successes from the attacker equal to or exceed the defender’s Soaks, roll for the weapon’s damage.

If successes do not equal or exceed the defender’s Soaks, the weapon isn’t rolled for damage, but \+1 damage is applied.

### Dual Wielding

If a character attacks with two weapons in hand, this is known as dual wielding.

\-1D when attacking, if successful the attacker may roll the damage of both weapons and choose the result of one damage roll.

Twitch checks for ranged combat follow the same rules, except AD may be spent for both weapons.

Special characteristics apply only for the weapon that is chosen to strike (as the attacker is not literally striking with both weapons, just choosing their preferred die result.)

### Grappling

Whenever a target is struck by a brawl weapon (bare fists, claws, etc) the attacker may opt to grapple the target instead of dealing damage. The defender will make a save vs physique, and if failed, they’re grabbed.

While grappled, the target is unable to move or act, and melee attacks against them assign damage as heavy. Ranged attacks have a coin flip’s chance of striking both the grappler and grappled.

The unlucky victim of a grapple may make a physique save on their turn to free themselves, and if successful, may proceed with their turn as normal.

## Ranged Combat

To shoot someone, an attacker must have clear line of sight on the target and the target must not exceed the weapon’s range. If the target exceeds the weapon’s range, the shooter is unable to hit the target at all. 

For reference on what constitutes a zone of range, refer to the section on ranges.

### 

### Aiming vs Quick-Firing

The shooter must choose between aiming or quick-firing; 

If aiming, the shooter will spend the turn preparing and lining up the shot. On their next turn, the shooter will make a Twitch Check and fire. The successes needed to hit are equal to the weapon’s Accuracy. Ammo dice may be spent to improve the roll.

If quick-firing, the shooter will forgo the turn spent aiming, but they cannot roll Twitch. The only way to fire is to spend ammo dice.

### Ammo Dice

When using a firearm, extra Ammo Dice can be added to the Twitch check (with the maximum amount depending on the weapon), representing full auto or burst fire. If quick-firing, these are the only dice that can be used to hit a target.

For every success above the weapon’s ACC stat, an extra shot lands \- with the caveat of the upper limit being however many Ammo Dice are used in the roll.

*For example, I fire a Geezer rifle into a bandit. I use two ammo dice and score three successes above the required ACC. Two extra shots are landed.*

Add an extra die to the Ammo Scarcity roll for each Ammo Dice used (more firepower \= more chance of running out of ammo).

### Ammo Scarcity

After shooting a firearm, roll a 2d6 dice. This determines if you need to reload or are out of ammo. 

If no 1s are rolled, carry on, soldier.  
If a singular 1 is rolled, the weapon needs to be reloaded. This will take an entire turn and you cannot be interrupted.  
If multiple 1s are rolled, the weapon is completely out of ammo. More must be found outside of combat.

### Throwing Weapons

When chucking a weapon or a grenade at an opponent, some special rules apply:

In order to throw a weapon, declare a target and roll a d6, representing the margin of error in the throw. Then, make a Twitch check, aiming to get successes equal to the roll.

If a melee weapon is thrown, it's treated as a single weight class lower for damage (heavy becomes medium, medium becomes light, light stays light.)

*For example, I throw a spear at a goblin. I roll a d6 and receive a 3\. I’ll need 3 successes or more from the Twitch check for the spear to hit it.*

Throwing a grenade mostly follow these same rules, however, special mechanics are at play to simulate grenades rolling and tumbling off course. Consult the info below to see how the grenade throw plays out:

Success: Those caught in the explosion radius may save vs Dodge to halve the damage (rounded down).   
Fail: Those caught in the explosion radius may save vs Dodge to avoid damage completely.

## Spellcasting

In order to cast a magickal spell or incantation, a turn must be spent to prepare the casting (like ranged attacks\!), after which on the next turn the spell may be cast.

## Wound Points

Whenever this book refers to inflicting or receiving damage, it is referring to Wound Points. Damage taken by a character is added cumulatively as Wound Points.

### Doom Rolls

Whenever a character receives Wound Points, or at the beginning of their turn, they’ll roll d6 dice equal to how many wound points they have. If any of the dice roll 1, the character passes out from shock.

That character will continue making Doom Rolls at the beginning of each of their turn. If no 1s are rolled, they get back up. If three or more 1s turn up at once, they succumb to their wounds and are killed.

### Big Damage (🗲)

Big Damage (referred to with the 🗲 symbol) represents a different scale of damage more suitable for armored tanks and explosive ordinance.

Big Damage is a 1:10 ratio with regular damage.

*For example, I am shot with a tank-shell point-blank \- and I receive 🗲 3 damage. That is 30 Wound Points\!*

### Head Hits

Head hits are especially dangerous: all assigned damage is doubled. Remember to wear a helmet\!

## 

## Stress Dice

During play, characters may witness frightening things, like grotesque violence or overwhelming odds. These situations will cause players to Save vs Fear, and failure will incur Stress Dice. Saves vs Fear receives \-1 for each Stress Dice a character already has.

Here are some things that could provoke saves vs Fear;

* Torches being snuffed out.  
* Grisly acts of violence.  
* A particularly terrifying beast.  
* British ‘cuisine’.

Stress dice should be of a different color than standard dice for the sake of differentiation. They are added to all Attribute checks as bonus dice. This is to represent the intensity of decision making while under extreme circumstances.

However, if any stress dice rolls a natural 1, the check is automatically failed – the character chokes up from fear, or second guesses an axe swing – whatever happens, the check is failed.

If a character would gain Stress Dice while already having 4 or more, they must make a save vs Death – dying of fright would be a pretty embarrassing way to go.

### Getting rid of Stress Dice

To calm your nerves, a character should remove themselves from dangerous situations and take a breather

It's up to GM discretion to the degree that rest and relaxation will help a character calm down \- but generally, if the character is somewhere safe and secure and partaking in some kind of recreation, they’ll remove all stress dice – while doing something like drinking in the middle of a dangerous expedition may only remove some stress dice.

### Addiction, Addiction Dice, and Overdoses

Certain substances feel a little too good. Whenever partaking in these chemicals, save vs Physique. On a failure, become addicted.

While addicted, the substance must be consumed once per day. Otherwise, the addict must make a save vs Physique – with failure resulting in gaining Addiction Dice. These are identical to Stress Dice, except for two differences;

* Addiction Dice do not disappear unless the subject of the addiction is partaken in.  
* Addiction Dice do not contribute to the successes of a roll. They don’t help you at all.

Once the addict has undergone 3 or more saves vs Physique – whether they’re successes or failures, the addiction is broken. All Addiction Dice disappear.

Whenever ingesting an addictive substance, if that same substance was taken at least 1d6 hours ago, instead make a save vs Death. On a success, become addicted – on a failure, complete organ failure.

## 

## Miscellaneous Gameplay Nuances

Below is a list of all sorts of details and facets of warfare that can’t be sorted into their own little sections.

### Going prone

If a character is lying on the ground, either by choice or by circumstance – all melee attacks targeting them will succeed, with the character having no chance of defending themself.

However, ranged attacks require an extra success to hit a prone target. Consider dropping down and hitting the deck if under fire.

### 

### Sneak attacks

If a target is snuck up on, and a character can ensure a killing blow with time and precision, the target is killed immediately without regard for such things as armor.

### Attacking from a moving vehicle or mount

If a melee attack is made while on a moving vehicle or mount, the attack will receive an extra 1d6 damage.

## 

| *Cover* | *Examples* | *Bonus Soaks* |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Bad cover | Wooden crates, furniture | \+1 |
| Decent cover | Sandbags, thick wood or thin metal | \+2 |
| Perfect cover | Thick metal, large stones | \+3 |

If a ranged attack is made, an extra success is required to hit the declared target.

### Cover

Once in cover, a character gains a bonus flat amount to Soaks to any limbs behind the cover.

If a character aims or casts spells from cover, that character’s arms and head are considered exposed.

### Catching fire (Ignited)

Some weapons and spells ignite their targets, covering them in burning material. Every second a character is on fire, they cannot take any other action except try to extinguish themselves. 

To extinguish themselves, a character must make a save vs Dodge on their first movement phase. Every turn spent on fire incurs 1d4 Wound Points that cannot be prevented by soaks.

### Poison

If a character ingests poison, they’ll make a save vs Physique. On a failure, they’ll take 1d6 damage and save vs Physique again, continuing the process until they succeed.

### 

If a poison is considered lethal, the character will instead make a save vs Death.

### Xom Contamination

Many areas are marked by Xom contamination, scars from the Black Day.

When in these areas for extended periods (12ish hours), roll d6 die equal to the decided severity of the contamination. Every 1 that turns up adds a Xom point to the character.

### Healing

Characters heal for one wound point every day. If the day is spent doing nothing, heal for 2 instead. Characters are unable to heal naturally unless they eat for the day.

### Fall Damage

Whenever a character falls from a height of 10ft or more, for every 10ft of distance between them and the ground, they receive 1d6 damage.

### Morale

NPCs both friendly and hostile must roll for morale when pressed. When a morale test is needed for a group of combatants, roll 2d6.

1-2: Disorganized rout. 50% of foes are left behind and surrender.  
3-6: Organized retreat.  
7+: Morale holds

Certain factors may increase or decrease the roll. A \+1 is considered a minor bonus, while a \+2 is a major bonus. A \+3 means rolling morale is not needed.

Common causes for a morale test include;

* 50% casualties.  
* 75% casualties.  
* Death or retreat of a leader.  
* Ambushed.  
* Overwhelming odds.

Common causes for bonuses to a morale test include;

* Hated cultural enemy.  
* Excellent or feared leadership.  
* Disciplined.

Common causes for detriments to a morale test include;

* Ill-disciplined.  
* Benign objective (robbery)  
* Frightened

# CHAPTER 14: WARBANDS AND FORTRESSES

*History shows that there are no invincible armies*   
*\- Joseph Stalin*

## Warbands

Once a character has amassed enough power and influence, the only horizon left is to control the land of Psydonia itself. The forming of armed forces and holding of territory is, in a way, the ultimate end goal for a character in BUGCHUD. 

To this end, BUGCHUD features mechanics for the command and inevitable bloodshed between armies, henceforth known as Warbands. They range from undisciplined hordes of miscreant creatures to highly trained, highly motivated, highly violent professional soldiers.

## How to Wage War

Turns between Warband commanders are done formation by formation \-- one commander moves a formation, and then their opponent or the GM will move one of their formations, and so on and so on.

A battle between armed forces will conclude with either the complete annihilation or retreat of formations.

Player characters will never die as a result of formation combat. They may, however, be captured if they are the last one standing or are left behind in a messy retreat.

### Warband Formations

Warbands consist of formations composed of armed combatants. They are assigned different types based on the training and equipment of the troops within the unit. This decides their sturdiness and how many casualties they can inflict in combat.

There is no hard set limit on how many soldiers may occupy a single formation. However, melee casualties may only be rolled for up to 20 units in an infantry formation, and 10 in a cavalry formation. Particularly crowded formations may have issues with morale.

It’s ultimately up to the GM as to what kind of formation a formation is. Below are the six variants, followed by examples.

#### Light Infantry

Untrained conscripts, peasants, archers, gunmen.

#### Medium Infantry

Mercenaries, trained warriors, beefy creatures like orcs.

#### Heavy Infantry

Armored knights, bipedal monsters like ogres and trolls, power-armor squads

#### Light Cavalry

Unarmored horsemen, motorcycles, unarmored jeeps.

#### Medium Cavalry

Semi-armored horsemen, semi-armored vehicles.

#### Heavy Cavalry

Mounted knights, tanks.

### Formation Movement

As distance is abstracted in Bugchud and movement is generally decided by the GM in the moment, formations don’t have exact measurements for how much ground they can cover. However, words of wisdom;

* More armor typically means slower movement and repositioning.  
* All cavalry is \<much\> faster than infantry, typically able to move double the distance of their footmen counterparts (ie, medium cavalry can move double that of medium infantry, etc).

Environmental factors may change or alter these expectations, such as muddy plains slogging down heavy cavalry (but leaving light infantry unimpeded) or advances up a hill taking longer.

A GM’s job is to approximate, and most importantly, arbitrate fairly.

### Casualties

For every casualty a formation receives, a unit within that formation is destroyed.

### Formation Morale

Formations follow the same exact rules for morale checks that NPCs follow in regular play, and the same bonuses and penalties can apply.

If the retreat is organized, the formation isn’t lost forever, it’s just gone for the battle. If the commanding character can avoid capture or death, they’ll regain control afterwards.

Think twice before employing such cowardly beasts as goblins, they may sooner yet turn tail and run than serve graciously.

### Formation Tech Levels

The GM will designate each formation as one of three tech levels, with each formation receiving \+1 to all dice rolls in melee against other formations for each degree of superiority;

1. Medieval (swordsmen, spearmen, archers)  
2. Industrial (vehicles, modern infantry)  
3. High Tech (power armor, laser weaponry, robots)

*For example, a formation of riflemen bayonet charge into a formation of goblin rabble. Both are light infantry, but since the rifle infantry are considered industrial, they’ll receive \+1 to the melee casualty roll.*

### Formation Armor

The GM will designate each formation as one of three armor levels, determining what weapons might pierce the comprising units’ steely hides (without this rule, we’d have archers and light infantry taking out tanks, and we can’t have that.)

1. Simple armor (most traditional body armor, like plate or leather. Can be damaged by all weaponry)  
2. Light armor. (light vehicle chassis and power armor. Pierced by smallarms fire, cannons and more heavy duty melee weapons like powersaws.)  
3. Heavy armor (tank and heavy vehicle armor. Pierced by specialty weaponry and howitzers.)

In cases of things like motorcycle formations, where the vehicle itself would be considered ‘light armor’ but their drivers are exposed, treat the formation as simple armor with the caveat of the vehicles being untouched.

## Melee Casualty Chart

Whenever a unit finds itself in melee combat, compare the troop types clashing to determine how to roll for casualties within the formations. Consult the chart below;

### 

### Melee Casualty Chart

*X:Y \= number of dice rolled (X) per unit in the formation (Y)*  
*Z+ \= minimum roll on dice needed to inflict a casualty.*

| Attacking → dEFENDING ↓ | lIGHT iNFANTRY | Medium Infantry | Heavy Infantry | Light Cavalry | Medium Cavalry | Heavy Cavalry |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| lIGHT iNFANTRY | 1:1, 6+ | 1/1, 5+ | 1/1, 4+ | 2/1, 5+ | 2/1, 4+ | 4/1, 5+ |
| Medium Infantry | 1:2, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 1/1, 5+ | 2/1, 6+ | 2/1, 5+ | 3/1, 5+ |
| hEAVY iNFANTRY | 1:3, 6+ | 1/2, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 2/1, 6+ | 2/1, 6+ |
| lIGHT cAVALRY | 1/2, 6+ | 1/2, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 1/1, 5+ | 2/1, 5+ |
| Medium Cavalry | 1/3, 6+ | 1/3, 6+ | 1/2, 6+ | 1/2, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 1/1, 5+ |
| hEAVY cAVALRY | 1/4, 6+ | 1/4, 6+ | 1/3, 6+ | 1/3, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ | 1/1, 6+ |

## Formation Ranged Combat

Formations with ranged weaponry roll 1d6 per unit in the formation, and every roll of 5+ is a casualty.

### Aiming and Reloading

Infantry that wish to fire ranged weapons must refrain from moving for a single phase, after that, they may fire every phase so long as they remain still.

Ranged cavalry, however, are not limited by this. They may move and then fire in the next phase as much as they want.

Weapons without cumbersome reloading may fire every turn, so long as they abide by the prior mentioned rules on aiming and movement. Weapons with cumbersome reloads (artillery, handgonnes, tank-cannons) can only fire once every other turn.

### Arcs and Friendly Fire

Archers and other units that can shoot at an angle may fire at an arc up and over at a target. Formations armed with rifles or rockets must have a clear line of sight, or risk friendly fire.

If ranged weapons without an arc are fired at a target with another formation in the way, the formation in the way will receive 2/3rds of the casualties instead, rounded up.

## Miscellaneous Warband Nuances

### Flanking

If a formation is charged in melee from behind or at a side-angle, that formation is considered to be flanked.

The flanking formation receives \+1 to all dice rolls when attacking on the flank, and formations that are flanked receive \-1 to morale checks.

### Artillery

Howitzers and cannons have special rules for inflicting casualties. When firing upon a target, they’ll roll 2d6, with the sum of the roll being the casualties inflicted on the target.

Artillery are manned by 2d4 light infantry.

### Attrition

Armies need to eat. If supplies cannot be procured via pillage, it must be gained through convoy lines.

If a formation hasn’t been fed in three days, morale will receive \-1 and must be rolled for. Organized retreats will simply march back the way they came in a mutiny, while disorganized retreats will see the formation go AWOL to wander and loot on their own accord. Continue rolling morale at the end of each day until proper supplies can be acquired.

Wizards  
Whether a player character within a formation or god forbid, an entire formation, magick users may cast their spells during warband battles. The GM should determine approximate rulings for each spell, but consider rulings such as these;

* Soak-piercing spells like lightning bolt effectively act as anti-armor weapons.  
* Spells with area of effects like fireball may be ruled as a kind of primitive artillery.

Spells require a phase for the wizard(s) to prepare their magick.

### Fortifications

If an infantry formation holds behind walls or barricades, they’ll receive \+1 dice per unit in the formation for melee combat.

If the fortifications are particularly grand, like castle walls, cavalry are utterly incapable of attacking. Only footmen may scale or attack.

Formations behind fortifications suffer casualties on rolls of 6+ from ranged fire, rather than 5+

## Fortresses

Having a roaming army isn’t enough to rule over Psydonia – you’ll need to own proper territory yourself, and with that, income to fuel your war efforts and infrastructure.

## Domain Dice

The intricacies of economies and production are abstracted into what will be referred to as Domain Dice; different aspects of rulership and income represented by different dice, to be assigned or spent in different sectors of your territory.

### 

### Labor Dice

Represents workers doing what they do best – working. Labor dice are assigned to things like factories, farms, plantations or mines. Each labor dice represents about 50 laborers.

At the end of each month, roll a d6 dice for each Labor Dice assigned to a production sector. On a roll 5+, the laborers create either one Value die.

Additionally, construction of fortress buildings will require labor dice to complete.

Each labor dice has a monthly upkeep of a Sack of Zennies. This is the wage given to them in exchange for the back-breaking work they provide.

If wages are not paid, 1d4 Labor Dice will abandon their tasks.

#### 

#### Slave Dice

A special kind of labor dice, representing the clasped in chains plight of slaves. Each slave die represents about 50 slaves.

Slave dice receive \+1 when rolled, but for each die that rolls a natural 1, those slaves are worked to death. Remove that die from play.

Slaves have no monthly wage, but instead may attempt to escape. Roll a 2d6 at the end of each month;

1-2: Slave revolt\! They rise up upon the territory, and wish to burn it all to the ground.  
3-6: 1d4 slave dice escape.  
7+: No change, they’re kept in line.

Common ways to add bonuses (+1) to this roll include;

* Sufficient security.  
* Scaring the piss out of them.

Common ways to add detriments (-1) to this roll include;

* Little to no security.  
* 2:1 ratio of slaves to laborers.  
* Entrusted with dangerous labors (weapons manufacturing)

### Value Dice & Trade Routes

Laborers create Value Dice, which can be sent on trade-routes to be converted into delicious, clinking Mammon coins.

After the Trade Dice’s departure, roll all of them as d6 and write down the sum. This is the base amount of payout for the trade route, and will be multiplied upon their return based on the length of the journey and the risk involved. The longer and more dangerous the trade route, the more payout\!

Every day spent on the road until arriving at the destination multiplies the payout value by 3x  
Every point of risk on the trade route multiplies the final payout value by 6x

#### Trade Route Risk

At the end of each day, roll 1d6 per point of risk on the trade route. For every natural 1, the shipment loses \-5 base payout. If the base payout ever reaches 0 or below, the convoy is considered lost.

#### Trade Route Generation

Before Trade Dice can be sent off, you’ll need trade routes to choose from. Roll;

* 2d6 days (total time away)  
* 1d6 points of risk.

Do this 1d4 times, and then the trade route may be chosen. At the end of each month, get rid of these trade routes and repeat the process.

The player’s faction may be considered to have always been trading with the same towns or polities, and the changing trade routes represent changes in route safety or shifting landscape,

The GM may offer special made trade routes that don’t disappear. These can be the result of diplomatic deals between other factions.

# CHAPTER 17: THE WORLD OF PSYDONIA

## 

## The setting of Bugchud

### 

### Dictionary

The words that Psydonians use are quite like ours, but there are a handful of terms that might seem strange to you and I. Below is a list of some of them.

#### Freek

Man of ill-repute and known hostility. To be a Freek is to be hated and attacked.

#### 

#### Creecher

Living thing of magical or divine origin, typically sapient or intelligent. Nite-creechers are creechers that specifically descend from Kain.

#### Beest

Creecher with connotations of more feral or animal-like qualities.

#### Zodomy

Slur for male on male homosexuality. One who practices zodomy is known as a zodomite. The term is derived from the forest of Zod, which was burnt to the ground for its occupants' hedonism and magickal madness.

#### Coal

Unpleasant or low quality. If something is coal, it is not agreeable to be around. Psydonians hate coal.

#### Gemerald

Used to describe things of high quality or intriguing premise. May also be shortened to gemmy, or simply a gem.

#### Dae/Nite/Munth/yil

When the sun is high in the sky, that is known as the dae. When the moon hangs low, it is the nite. There are (roughly) 30 daes and nites in a munth, and there are 12 munths in a yil.

The BUGCHUD rules still use the term day, night, month and year as the reader is likely more familiar with those.

#### Cackleberry

Egg of a creecher or beest, also slang for testicles.

#### Pintle

Male reproductive organ. Its removal is a fate worse than death for many.

#### 

#### Zizoid

Of having relation or association with Zizo. It is a vicious accusation, and many are called to violence – either against the accused, or the accuser.

#### Frag-monster

Psycho killer that does nothing but plot for more wealth and murder. They have no personality and don’t seem to care if they live or die. It is unknown if this is caused by a magickal curse, but there is no known cure except death.

#### tRVE Cvlture

Less of slang itself and more of a phenomenon. Some humens replace the U with a V in writing, claiming it is more traditional or aesthetic. They claim to represent the trve cvlture of their ancestors.

#### Sparkle-Skin

Overtly strange and colorful person who annoys others with their gaudy words, narcissism and stupid outfits.

#### Gruuning

Dedicating long periods of time to carnal pursuits, typically lonesome in nature. Most Psydonians consider gruuning to be in poor taste and kept to privacy.

#### Awesome-Sauce

Juvenile expression of excitement or finding something stylish. It’s derived from an old delicacy lost to history, missed by men whose father’s fathers were the last ones to taste it.

#### Grognard

Someone who lost themselves to rose tinted glasses and nostalgia.

#### Wizard

If used as slang, a term for a hopeless virgin – implying they are too busy studying tomes to develop relationships.

#### Fatherless

Term for immature anger, insecurity or even promiscuity, implying an absent father during childhood.

#### Tacklephag

One who engages in dishonorable fighting techniques. Named after Tack-Lephag, an infamous Gronnish criminal.

#### Highly Regarded

A sarcastic insult that implies mental deficiency and/or physical deformities.

#### Fairy-Touched

Person whose mind is shaped by particularly strange eccentricities or obsessions. Often used as a slur, but it is growing popular to label oneself as fairy-touched.

#### Garnish

To bribe.

#### Raegyn

Darkest insult imaginable \- the only way to regain one’s honor is to kill the man who uttered it. Despite its taboo, nobody remembers what a Raegyn is.

#### Smerd

Lowborn of no status.

#### Maneater

Toothed outgrowths of the New Flesh that emerge from the ground, which snag and bite at the limbs of those who tread underfoot. Also slang for female reproductive organs.

### Regions

The remnants of Psydon’s empire. The kingdoms of man are disunified and in constant conflict with both themselves and others.

#### Kingsfield

Once among the most stable of the successor kingdoms, Kingsfield has declined in recent years in due part to the fanaticism of her majesty; Queen Johanna IV. Having abandoned the faith of her family, she embraced belief in the restoration of Psydon, and to this end, ordered the creation of the Quite-So-Holy Inquisition (QSHI). Stake burnings, hangings and beheadings are common, and the land itself verges on outright civil war.

*Only her Majesty knows the true extent of the inquisition’s list; for Terror is the order of the day, as all is righteous in the face of evil.*

#### Volfwood

Swampland of the hideous sort – Volfwood is as diseased as it is hostile, and is home to smugglers, witches and madmen. It was once a proud kingdom, but it fell to disrepair and cruelty following the Inhumen Crisis. Its dishonor stains the annals of history; Its old king, whose name has been stricken from records and forgotten – was the first of the lords of men to betray Psydon, pledging his levies to Graggar’s legion.

*At night, he wept; for as the world would never forgive him, he would never forgive himself.*

#### Fablefield

Enchanted land of joys and rainbows. Fablefield is inhabited by Elves who never aligned themselves with Zizo’s blasphemy, who instead pledged themselves to the immortal Eight as an omen of a new world. They recluse themselves to their own lives, away from the terrors of the outside world \- yet many younger Elves exhaust themselves of lutes and plays, seeking adventure beyond the magickal glades.

*They’ve forgotten their own tongue, their own Gods and old glories – but they don’t care.*

*They are happy.*

#### 

#### Zybantia

Foreign land of exotic delights, Zybantia is considered the kingdom of world’s desire. Through sheer luck and the guile of its original rulers, the land retains many of the wonders of Psydon’s rule. Although blessed by these treasures, the dynastic houses of Zybantia create constant political strife between themselves as they vie for the supreme title of TRVE CIEZER.

*For centuries, armies have battled, families have shattered, and countless gallons of blood have soaked the sands — all in pursuit of becoming the TRVE CIEZER.*

*Nobody even remembers what it means.*

#### Gronn

Wide steppe lands of the frigid North, where the raven and dark-star once pledged their arms together. Those nomads upon the Southern plains praise Ravox and his heroism, while the Northern hills worship Graggar. Bitter feuds and raids are common between these clans, even amongst those of the same faith, whose conflicts often spill over into sedentary kingdoms.

*He said:*  
*I will fill your mouths with sugar.*  
*I will drape your bellies in silk and brocade.*  
*Everything is mine\!*  
*I do not know fear.*  
*I will mount the whole world to my saddle\!*

#### Heartfelt

Land of chivalry and cavalry. The knights of Heartfelt are renowned for both their honor and arrogance. It is the last among the lands of man to scorn SCOM technology, which they declare alien and opposed to the ideal of the saintly knight – and likewise, the Shylock Cults have no presence. Those peasants that till the land here are treated as cattle by their lords and ladies, who they thank for the opportunity to be worked to the bone.

*O’ red dragon banner unfurled – those knights of Heartfelt gallop upon heathenry, as chivalry demands so.*

#### Giza

Last true bastion of the Old-Faith. Those who hail from the arid land of Giza are proud of their Psydonite heresies, as there is no truer fanatic for the long-gone God-King than these curious people. They fashion effigies of the Immortal Eight to burn and curse, and observe antiquated rituals and festivals to honor Psydon. Try as many might, the Gizans will never be proselytized.

*Come ‘ye who betray the God-King, as it was he who crafted us from mud and dust – and upon his return, shall the skies part and his violence upturn this world.*

#### Otovlund

Land of heathen converts, who still retain many of the traditions of their ancestors. Treated with suspicion and ridicule by other faithful, they are motivated by a constant need to prove to the world of their virtue and to absolve themselves of their hereditary guilt. Constant crusades and expeditions into heathen-lands to burn monuments and seize territory have set those who hail from Otovlund apart as hardy footmen.

*According to legend, the old heathen king of Otovlund had journeyed down South for a raid; only to be transfixed by a statue of Eora.*

#### Grenzelhoft

Grenzelhoft is known for its tall women, pastries and beer \-- but its true strength lies in its fighting men. The land hosts the most elite mercenaries in the known world, known as landsknechts, whose colorful outfits and puffy jackets announce proudly they are no common cutthroats. There are scarce finer warriors in Psydonia, and all desire their services.

While the land of Grenzelhoft is officially made up of many smaller polities, the territory in its entirety is de facto ruled by the Großkäse, supreme military commander of the landsknechts.

Snow-white, there extends a linen.  
Stretched over streets and meadows.  
Snow-white, our paths are shimmering  
Broken bridges behind us.  
Homeland so far away.

#### Catolona

Glorious land of wheat and gold. It is the homeland of the mortal Astrata. Catolona was once known for its religious conflict and romantic duelists, but its fame now lies with its famed explorers, who claim they have discovered a new continent across the ocean. Adventurers of every stripe and creed now travel to the ports of Catolona, hoping to find themselves on a ship toward this new world.

They bring back tales of cities made of gemeralds and talking cats. Only a fool would believe these tall-tales – had they not brought back silver and gold.

### Locations

A list of noteworthy locales and places within the world of Psydonia.

#### The Polar Summit

A tower in the farthest North, once the world-throne of the God-King of man. The tower was torn down by Zizo’s command-- all that is left is crumbling slate; evidence of a bygone tyranny now battered by hail and snow. Many journey to these ruins to either pay their respects to an age soon to be forgotten, or to come on pilgrimage and celebrate the beginning of the end times.

*When Zizo’s fingers wrapped upon Psydon’s wounded throat, she saw behind his eyes what no man or woman could ever dream of seeing.*

*Fear.*

#### Sudomra

The largest among the Elvish city-states, Sudomra is a vast metropolis stretching out farther than the eye can see. The council which oversees this micro-nation claim that the city is the birthplace of Zizo, and that they themselves represent her legacy. This is, of course, merely a means of legitimacy \-- for Sudomra is a place of sinister fortunes and black deeds, and schemes within plots are the norm for all who abide here.

*It is a legend among true believers, that somewhere in an untouched clearing; there lies Zizo’s home, untouched by the age of years.*

#### Elwa-Kawn

Legendary kurgan grave. It is here that Graggar and Ravox declared their comradery. In accordance with Gronn tradition, they swore upon their ancestors beneath the ground that the clubs and blades that assail one, shall assail both. They granted each other gifts; Ravox offered his sister Eora as a bride and Graggar offered the raven-helm.

Many journey here to pay their respects, either as praise for their favored figure or at pity for what could have been.

*Ravox and Graggar had been raised together, and they were known to be inseparable. It was apparent that BOTH were destined for greatness.*

### Factions

Loose conglomerates, organizations and groups within the world of Psydonia. It is worth noting that even those that align in ideology and faith are prone to fractious infighting and violence \-- for in the Bugchud, it is all against all.

#### The Immortal Church

Formed following the conclusion of the Inhumen Crisis, the Immortal Church claims to represent the will and virtue of the Immortal Eight. Led by the supreme pontiff and a council of patriarchs, it officiates clergy and provides legitimacy to rulers by way of divine right. To openly defy the church would mean excommunication.

*With the Inhumen Crisis ended, a new era dawned upon the world – behold, o’ mortal virtue clad in divine shell; hail to you, Gods\!*

### 

#### The Outer Dark

Demented psychopaths and lunatics, sinister even by Zizoid standards – monsters and men who align themselves with the Outer Dark are granted hideous ability and intelligence, at the cost of their sanity. It is nonexistence made manifest.

There is no greater an enemy than the dreaded Outer Dark.

*Bereft of divinity, alien even to the cosmos – for even followers of Zizo desire new beginnings in the true heavens.* 

*those of the outer dark desire nothing.*

#### Shylock Cults

Overlord tyrants of finance, the Shylock Cults worship Mammon as the only true divinity. They are found everywhere in Psydonia, and all do business with them. Those who make themselves an enemy of the cults are not long for this world. 

*Holding no loyalty to neither the eight nor inhumenity, the Shylock cults embrace the best of all worlds – offering SCOM tech to the righteous, and slaves to the unholy.*

#### Obriskon Litters

Hideous rodent beasts. The Obriskon are dog-sized, sentient rats with the curious ability to warp their own flesh. They often kill the leadership of organizations or royal courts and masquerade as their victims, diverting resources to live in comfort and excess.

*Those at the bottom will believe they serve the same*  
*men they have always, while all the while, they receive orders to secure shipments of cheddar cheese and barrels of fermented whore’s piss.*

#### The Battalion

Led by a man known only as Great Leader, this band of soldiers were once the most loyal battalion in Psydon’s army. Now, they have been charged by their commander with the task of destroying all traitors to the old world-order – for Psydon could never truly die, and all men who believe in such rumors are simply lacking in morale.

*General Order 54: in compliance with prior communications with the god-king, offensive maneuvers are designated for all targets, civilian or otherwise. Refrain only upon direct order from Great-Psydon.*

#### The New Flesh of Psydonia

An amalgam of black magick and cursed meat, the New Flesh is the fell-God of the most feral mutants and scum of the Darklands. Stretching miles below the ground, it beckons both the living and dead to join its mass; so that one day, its gurgling body may sweep over the world.

*On the Black Day, men and women gathered together in huddled masses to pray.*

*And still, they pray.*

#### Darkland City States

Those myriad of polities that checker the wastish Darklands are known simply as city states. Ruled by Elvish overlord-tyrants, these unpleasant hubs of Zizoid influence are where most Elves are born and raised. Their hellish factories and perfumer dens require steady sources of slaves to maintain their production. 

*O’ open wounds upon the land stretching upward, black smog smoke to choke the sky; those who enter the city states, shall never leave whole.*

#### Dwarf Fortresses

The dwarf fortresses line up and down the hills and mountains of Psydonia, their strongholds carving down into the stony flesh of the world. They are well fortified and nigh impenetrable, their occupants living off of a steady diet of fungus. The treasures of these strongholds are the envy of all the civilized and uncivilized races.

*Nary a more treasured sight, than the shining gleam of a gemerald \-- and no more a disappointing one, to behold coal.*

#### Freemen

Bandits, revolutionaries and rebelling peasants oft’ swear loyalty to Matthios, becoming to themselves heroes fighting against an unjust world. In reality, many take to pillage and violence simply for personal gain or thrill. They live outside or on the fringes of society, ambushing travellers and attacking undefended monasteries to loot their wealth.

It is the honor of any freeman to kill a noble or priest.

*We are matthios’ black band.*  
*Hiya, ho ho\!*  
*And we will stamp out tyranny.*  
*Hiya, Ho Ho\!*

#### SCOM Guilds

Old assembly of machinists and tinkerers. The original SCOM Guilds were put to the sword by Psydon’s legions for their refusal to aid him, and their secrets died with them.

During the Inhumen Crisis, Zizo returned their knowledge to the world and a new generation of engineers aided the apocalypse. Their creations still haunt the darklands, and many technicians find employment in creating new abominable contraptions.

*In some ways, the world has begun to resemble that old prehistory – even the polities of men enjoy what were once considered heathen machines.*

### Historical Events and Periods

A rough timeline of history – common knowledge even to most amateur of learned men. Periods are unlabeled, events are labeled with an asterisk (\*)

#### The World Before Time

Mysterious prehistory, a time of old magicks and Elves. Psydon burned all records and cut off the tongues of Elvish story-tellers, condemning knowledge of this era to obscurity.

#### Psydonian Empire

Ancient golden age of heartless tyranny. Psydon ruled the known world with a grip of cold iron, and Humenity reigned as his chosen people. All fiefdoms paid tribute and fealty to the god-king, whose peace was maintained by fear.

*Uroa onorha sia oyaltyla. Eha illwa eliversa sua.*

#### The Inhumen Crisis

The almost-apocalypse which brought Psydonia to its knees. It began with the death of Psydon and the ascension of the Inhumen Pantheon, who sought the end of all things by means of the dark-star. Millions died, and the world still bears its scars.

*A time of prophecy, villains and heroes – but it’s all over now.*

*There are no more legends.*

#### The Black Day\*

Zizo’s spite, which rendered one-third of the world desolate. As the Inhumen crisis came to a close, she gave her life and soul in a final act of rebellion; poisoning the world that she hated out of love.

*Some go as far to say that Psydonia should have died that day – that the world that exists now was never meant to live.*

#### The Bugchud

The current era in which Psydonia finds itself in. It is characterized by warring strife and instability, even among relatively safe kingdoms. It is a time of adventure and opportunity, but also chaos and violence.

*This shit sucks, man.*

### Miscellaneous Knowledge

Concepts and things that just don’t neatly tie in to other categories of designation. Some of these contain game-rules for interaction with them.

#### Dungeons

Following Psydon’s war against the Elves, their wealth, grimoires and moonlit jewels were looted by those Humen warlords who aided the God-king, store away in hidden tombs. These vaults and treasure troves line all over Psydonia, deep beneath the ground – many of which are still untouched; either infested with hideous beasts, or nobody left to remember their presence. They are nearly always filled with dangerous traps.

Most unlooted dungeons are found within the Darklands, whose inhospitality and danger prevent many from making the expeditions.

*Zizo, unable to make the expedition alone, hired three men; Graggar, Ravox, and Matthios, promising a share of the treasures.*

*Was it unseen destiny, or was it planned?*

#### Nite-Creechers

Supernatural beasts that burn in daylight, encompassing creechers such as vampyres, werewolves and trolls. All nite-creechers descend from Kain, who they consider their father.

No two nite-creechers are exactly the same, and they are universally weak to specific metals. While touching or pierced by this metal, the nite-creecher will fail all checks and saves.

Roll 1d4 to determine a nite-creecher’s metal weakness;

1) Copper  
2) Silver  
3) Cold Iron  
4) Gold

*Kain, wishing to court Zizo, cursed himself with learned sorcery and offered his flesh as sacrifice. Impressed with his commitment, Zizo instead granted him as much power as he had weakness.*

#### SCOM Tech

Advanced technology of unholy origin, summoned back to this world by Zizo. Once considered anathema to the laws of man, the stigma has lessened, and all manner of devices find their ways into the polities of the faithful.

*Zizo peeled back the eons of time – and found that we’ve all been here once before.*

#### Deadites

Zizo’s first reckoning upon the world was to destroy the cycle of death and rebirth. In its absence, the souls of the dead are obliterated, the flesh of their bodies taking on their own hunger; the first walking deadites of Psydonia.

If a sentient creature is slain, and their body does not receive a proper rite of Necra, there is a 10% chance they will rise as a deadite in 1d4 days. They will crave the brain-flesh of the still living, and are only capable of groaning and shambling.

Necromancers may perform special rites to guarantee the rise of a deadite, and in this case, they are binded to the necromancer and will obey all orders from them.

Deadites will never pass out from wounds or pain \-- and they will never fail morale checks. They will fight until their bodies fall apart.

*Concerning the destruction of the once-eternal soul, Zizo considered it a mercy upon Psydonia \- free of the pantokrator’s cycle, free to rejoin the cosmos.*

*had she not taken it upon herself to free the universe, she would have done it to herself.*

#### Skeleletons

In life, these walking sacks of bones were dedicated followers of Zizo, and upon their deaths, they chose not to destroy their own souls; but to animate their bony frame by means of black magick.

Skeleletons are known for their black humor. They are prone to bone related puns in the midst of combat, taunting and laughing as they advance \- but make no mistake, to fall victim to a skeleleton is a fate worse than death, and their merry demeanor hides a sadism found only in the deepest pits of Hell.

Like deadites, skeleletons will never fail morale checks.

*I’ve got a bone to pick with you\! NYHAAHAAHAA\!*

#### The Red Grin

Sickness created through sinister rite by Graggar following his ascension. Unshackles those afflicted from moral constraint and imparts an intense desire for grotesque violence. 

The afflicted retain all memories and skills from before infection, and can use this knowledge for their own ends.

If unable to sate their urges on the uninfected, they will turn on eachother – and eventually, begin self mutilation.

Spread via bodily fluids, infection follows in mere seconds.

Cannot be cured except via miraculous or magical means.

The vast majority of those afflicted by the Red Grin are single minded in their pursuits, and incapable of long term planning. However, exceptions exist. If infected, roll a d1000 and check the results below;

1-999: incapable of even basic forward planning, mostly communicates in screams and profanity, no care for hygiene.  
1,000: most intellect is retained, capable of long term planning and coordination, capable of delaying gratification.

*Hideous creation of Graggar. Urban cities were swept over by waves of infected who killed and maimed all in their path.*

*In time, however, their violence turned inward. Those that weren’t mutilated out of boredom died to the chilling cold of winter – too gore drunk to even care they were freezing to death.*

#### The Dark-Star

Also known as the Sinistar, whose ebon majesty devoured the old sun. Created by Graggar during the Inhumen Crisis, it was meant to be the end of all creation; to wipe the slate clean, once and for all. Not even star-light could escape – and the world lay in near total blackness.

It is the ambition of all Inhumen worshippers to restore the Dark-Star

*The souls of millions, ground to water – to feed the dark-star, so that the land and sea might be swallowed.*

*Its grin still haunts the world.*

#### The Golden Serpent

Legendary creature from the world before time, said to be the progenitor of all dragons. The Golden Serpent was found by Xylix deep within the bowels of the world. Now, it is binded to the Inhumen Matthios as his jail warden.

*By luck, the mortal Xylix stumbled upon an old divine beast, which offered him a deal; feed me gold, and I will help you save this world.* 

### Languages

Across the land of Psydonia exists all sorts of exotic alphabets and clicking noises. Here is a list of languages that exist.

#### Psydish Uncommon

Pysdon’s attempt at standardized, universal communication for the once disparate tribes under his rule. It is an artificial language that kind of sounds like pig Latin. Its use has waned since Psydon’s passing, but it is still the de-facto common tongue.

Each player character naturally knows how to speak Psydish Uncommon.

*Ewa reaa loriousga, osa ayssa psydon.*

#### The Black Tongue

Spoken by followers of Zizo and unsightly nite-creechers, it was once the universal language of Psydonia before the rise of Humenity. Zizo restored its tomes, and educated her inner circle in the language of her ancestors.

*✌︎■︎♎︎ ☪︎♓︎⌘︎□︎ ⬧︎◻︎□︎🙵♏︎🖴︎ ●︎♏︎⧫︎ ◆︎⬧︎ ♌︎♏︎ ❒︎♏︎♌︎□︎❒︎■︎📬︎*

#### Battalion

Battalion is a language devoted to war. Its vocabulary is extensive only so far as to date the times of bayonet charges, coordinate flanking maneuvers, and organize the logistics of blitzkrieg. Once spoken by Psydon’s elite standing armies, its use has declined and survives only by virtue of nostalgists and immortal soldierly.

*Ten-hut\!*

#### Grenzelhoftan

#### Catalonan

#### 

#### Gronnish
